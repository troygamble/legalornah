In Sydney, Australia, the legality of flying a drone without registration depends on the weight of the drone and its intended use. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) regulates drone operations in Australia. Drones weighing more than 250 grams must be registered with CASA before they can be flown outdoors. This registration process involves providing details about the drone and the operator. For recreational use, if the drone weighs 250 grams or less, it does not require registration. However, all drone operators must follow CASA's safety rules, which include flying only in visual line-of-sight, not flying near emergency operations, and not flying higher than 120 meters.

**Trivia:** Australia was one of the first countries to regulate the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) for commercial purposes, starting as early as 2002.
