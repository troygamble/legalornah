In Montana, unlike most other states, it is generally not legal to fire an employee for no reason once they have completed their probationary period. This is because Montana has implemented the Wrongful Discharge From Employment Act (WDEA), which deviates from the 'at-will' employment doctrine prevalent across the United States. Under the WDEA, after the initial probationary period, an employer must have good cause to terminate an employee. This means the employer needs a legitimate business reason related to the employee's job performance or conduct.

**Trivia:** Montana is the only state in the U.S. that is not entirely at-will, making it unique in its approach to employment termination laws.
