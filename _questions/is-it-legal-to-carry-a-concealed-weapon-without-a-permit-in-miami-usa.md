In Miami, Florida, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. Florida law requires individuals who wish to carry a concealed weapon to obtain a Concealed Weapon License (CWL) issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. This license requires the applicant to meet certain criteria, including being at least 21 years old, completing a firearms training course, and passing a background check. Carrying a concealed weapon without meeting these requirements can result in criminal charges, including fines and possible jail time.

**Trivia:** Florida was one of the first states to enact a 'shall-issue' concealed carry law in 1987, which significantly simplified the process for law-abiding citizens to obtain a concealed carry permit.
