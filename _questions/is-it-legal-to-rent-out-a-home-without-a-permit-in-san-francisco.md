In San Francisco, whether you need a permit to rent out a home depends primarily on the type of rental and the duration. For long-term rentals, San Francisco does not generally require a specific rental permit, but landlords must comply with registration and safety regulations enforced by the San Francisco Rent Board and other city agencies. However, for short-term rentals, such as those often listed on platforms like Airbnb, a permit is strictly required. The city mandates that anyone offering short-term rentals must obtain a Short-Term Residential Rental Certificate from the Office of Short-Term Rentals. This certificate ensures that the rental meets safety standards and the host complies with local laws limiting the number of days a property can be rented out annually without the host present.

**Trivia:** San Francisco was one of the first major cities to regulate short-term rentals rigorously, largely in response to the housing crisis and the rise of platforms like Airbnb, which significantly impacted local housing markets.
