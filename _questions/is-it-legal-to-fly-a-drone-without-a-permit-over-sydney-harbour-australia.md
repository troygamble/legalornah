Flying a drone over Sydney Harbour in Australia is subject to specific regulations primarily enforced by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). The legality of flying a drone in this area without a permit depends on several factors including the type of drone, its weight, and the purpose of the flight. Generally, drones weighing over 250 grams require registration and the operator must follow CASA's safety rules, which include keeping the drone within visual line-of-sight, not flying over populous areas, and maintaining a certain distance from people and structures. Sydney Harbour, being a populous area and close to heliports and an airport, has stricter no-fly zones which typically require special permission or a permit to fly a drone.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is not only famous for its iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge but also for its role in various film productions. Drone footage has been increasingly popular in capturing the stunning vistas of the harbour for both commercial and artistic purposes.
