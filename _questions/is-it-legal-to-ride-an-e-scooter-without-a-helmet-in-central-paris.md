In central Paris, it is legal to ride an e-scooter without wearing a helmet, as helmets are not mandated by French law for e-scooter riders. However, it is highly recommended for safety reasons, particularly in urban areas like central Paris where traffic can be dense and unpredictable. The French government emphasizes safety measures for e-scooter riders, such as the use of reflective clothing during night or in poor visibility conditions, and adhering to traffic rules that apply to all vehicles.

**Trivia:** Paris has implemented several regulations specific to e-scooters, including speed limits and designated parking zones, in response to the rapid increase in their popularity and the challenges associated with their integration into the city's transport ecosystem.
