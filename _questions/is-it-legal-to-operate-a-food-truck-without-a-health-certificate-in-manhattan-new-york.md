In Manhattan, New York, as well as throughout the city, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health certificate. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene requires all mobile food vendors to obtain and display a Mobile Food Vending License. This license ensures that the food truck meets specific health and safety standards aimed at protecting the public. The health certificate is part of the licensing process and must be visibly displayed on the vehicle. Inspections are conducted regularly, and failure to comply with health codes can result in fines or the revocation of the license.

**Trivia:** New York City is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering everything from gourmet meals and ethnic cuisines to classic street food. The city even hosts an annual event called the Vendy Awards, which is often referred to as the 'Oscars' of food trucks, celebrating the best street food vendors in the city.
