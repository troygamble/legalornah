In the United States, it is legal to mail a coconut without any packaging, as long as it adheres to the mailing regulations set by the United States Postal Service (USPS). The USPS allows for the mailing of coconuts without additional packaging if they are properly addressed and have sufficient postage. This unusual mailing practice is often used for promotional purposes, gifts, or as a novelty item for special occasions.

**Trivia:** Molokai, Hawaii, is famous for its 'Post-a-Nut' service where you can send a painted coconut from the local post office as an alternative to traditional postcards or souvenirs.
