In Japan, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) is legal, including in downtown Tokyo. VPNs are commonly utilized for enhancing online privacy and security by encrypting users' internet traffic and masking their IP addresses. This technology is particularly useful in bypassing geo-restrictions, allowing users to access content that might be limited to certain regions, such as streaming services. However, while the use of VPNs is legal, it is important to note that how you use a VPN can affect the legality of your actions. For instance, using a VPN to engage in illegal activities, such as accessing pirated content, remains illegal regardless of VPN use.

**Trivia:** Japan is known for its strict anti-piracy laws, which were further tightened in 2020 to include illegal downloading of copyrighted materials, with penalties including up to two years in prison.
