In Toronto, Canada, the legality of renting out a room without a permit largely depends on the specific circumstances and the nature of the rental. For short-term rentals (less than 28 consecutive days), Toronto has specific regulations that require homeowners to register with the city and obtain a license. This regulation is primarily aimed at properties listed on platforms like Airbnb. For long-term rentals, there is generally no need for a special permit, but landlords must comply with the Residential Tenancies Act, which governs landlord and tenant relationships and ensures the rental property meets health, safety, maintenance, and occupancy standards.

**Trivia:** Toronto's regulation of short-term rentals was implemented in part to address the impact of these rentals on the availability and cost of housing in the city, a concern in many major cities worldwide.
