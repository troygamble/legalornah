In Paris, France, renting out your home as a vacation rental is subject to specific regulations and restrictions, primarily aimed at controlling the short-term rental market and ensuring housing availability for residents. Homeowners are allowed to rent out their primary residence (the home in which they live for at least 8 months a year) as a short-term rental for up to 120 days per year. However, they must register with the city to obtain a registration number, which must be displayed on all rental listings. For properties that are not the ownerâ€™s primary residence, converting them into short-term vacation rentals requires a change of use permit, which involves a complex process including compensating for the loss of residential housing by creating equivalent residential space elsewhere in the city.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on vacation rentals, partly due to the city's efforts to preserve local neighborhoods and housing stock in the face of increasing tourist numbers. Interestingly, Paris has one of the highest densities of Airbnb listings in the world, which has led to significant legal and regulatory responses from the city authorities.
