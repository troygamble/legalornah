In central Paris, it is generally required to register with the city authorities before renting out a room or any accommodation on platforms like Airbnb. The city of Paris has implemented strict regulations to manage short-term rentals, primarily to prevent a shortage of long-term housing options for residents. A registration number must be obtained and displayed on the listing on Airbnb. This registration helps the city track the number of days the property is rented out, as there is a legal limit of 120 days per year for a primary residence. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines. Additionally, if the property is not the host's primary residence, a commercial license might be required, which involves a more complex process including changing the property's usage status.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most active markets for Airbnb, with thousands of listings available across the city. The city authorities have been particularly vigilant in regulating short-term rentals due to concerns over housing availability and the preservation of local neighborhoods.
