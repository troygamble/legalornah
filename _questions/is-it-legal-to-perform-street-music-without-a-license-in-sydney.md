In Sydney, the legality of performing street music without a license varies based on the specific location and the regulations set by the local council. Most areas within the City of Sydney require buskers to obtain a permit to perform in public spaces. These permits help manage public safety and ensure that the performances do not disrupt local businesses or residents. The process for obtaining a busking permit involves an application to the local council, and often a performance audition or the presentation of a portfolio. The regulations and requirements can differ significantly between different councils within Sydney, so it is essential for street musicians to check the specific requirements of the area where they wish to perform.

**Trivia:** Sydney is known for its vibrant street performing scene, particularly at iconic locations like Circular Quay and Darling Harbour. These spots often attract a diverse array of musicians and artists, contributing to the city's lively cultural atmosphere.
