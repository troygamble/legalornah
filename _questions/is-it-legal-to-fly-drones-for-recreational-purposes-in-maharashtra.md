Flying drones for recreational purposes is legal in Maharashtra, but it comes with several restrictions and requirements as outlined by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in India. Recreational drone users must adhere to the guidelines which include not flying drones above 400 feet, maintaining a visual line of sight at all times, and avoiding no-fly zones such as near airports, military bases, and areas where privacy could be compromised. Additionally, all drones except for those in the Nano category (weighing less than 250 grams) must be registered with the DGCA, and operators must obtain an Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit (UAOP) if the drone weighs more than 2 kilograms.

**Trivia:** Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra, was one of the first cities in India to have drone-based surveillance implemented by the police to monitor and manage large gatherings and festivals, showcasing the integration of modern technology in public safety measures.
