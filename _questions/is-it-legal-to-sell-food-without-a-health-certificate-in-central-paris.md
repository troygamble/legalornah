In central Paris, as in the rest of France, it is illegal to sell food without a health certificate. This requirement is part of a broader regulatory framework aimed at ensuring food safety and public health. The health certificate demonstrates that the individual or business selling the food complies with national hygiene standards, which are strictly enforced by French health authorities. These regulations are designed to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure that all food products sold to the public are safe for consumption.

**Trivia:** France has a long history of culinary excellence and is known for its strict food safety laws. Interestingly, the first food safety laws in France can be traced back to the Middle Ages, when regulations regarding the sale of meat and bread were implemented to protect consumers.
