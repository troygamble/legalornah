In Ontario, the legality of smoking cannabis in public depends on specific regulations similar to those governing tobacco smoking. Under the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, smoking cannabis is generally allowed wherever smoking tobacco is permitted. However, there are numerous restrictions. For instance, smoking cannabis is prohibited in enclosed public spaces, enclosed workplaces, and other specified outdoor areas such as near schools and on children's playgrounds. Additionally, individual municipalities may have their own bylaws that further restrict where cannabis can be smoked, making it important for individuals to be aware of local laws.

**Trivia:** Canada became the second country in the world to legalize cannabis nationwide in 2018. However, the rules regarding where you can smoke cannabis vary significantly across different provinces and territories.
