In France, the use of drones, especially in densely populated areas like Paris, is subject to strict regulations to ensure safety, privacy, and security. Flying drones over Paris, particularly near landmarks, is generally prohibited without prior authorization. This is governed by both national aviation laws and specific local regulations. The French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) mandates that drone operators must adhere to no-fly zones, which often include areas around landmarks, airports, and military zones. Additionally, Paris has enhanced security measures due to its status as a capital city and a major tourist destination, which further restricts drone activities around sensitive areas.

**Trivia:** France was one of the first countries to integrate drone regulations into its national aviation laws, reflecting its proactive approach to managing this technology's integration into its airspace.
