In Munich, Germany, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) itself is legal as they are commonly used for enhancing privacy and security online. However, the legality of using a VPN specifically for accessing streaming services can depend on several factors, including the terms of service of the streaming platform and the purpose of using the VPN. Many streaming services have terms that restrict the use of tools or technology to circumvent geo-restrictions. This is primarily to enforce licensing agreements that vary by country. If a user employs a VPN to access content that is not licensed for viewing in Germany, this could potentially violate the terms of service of the streaming platform.

**Trivia:** Germany is known for its stringent privacy laws and was one of the first countries to adopt data protection laws, reflecting its citizens' high value on privacy.
