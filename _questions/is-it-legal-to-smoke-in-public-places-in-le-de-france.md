In Île-de-France, the legality of smoking in public places depends on the specific type of public place. France's public health laws prohibit smoking in all enclosed public spaces, which includes workplaces, public transportation, and places serving food or drinks, such as bars and restaurants. This law is designed to protect non-smokers from secondhand smoke. However, smoking may be permitted in open-air public places such as streets and parks, although some restrictions can apply in specific areas like near schools or on the premises of hospitals.

**Trivia:** France was one of the early European countries to implement strict smoking bans in public places. The country has also introduced plain cigarette packaging to reduce smoking rates, which is part of a broader public health initiative to combat tobacco use.
