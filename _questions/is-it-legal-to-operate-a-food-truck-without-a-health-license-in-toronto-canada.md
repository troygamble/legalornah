In Toronto, Canada, operating a food truck without a health license is illegal. The City of Toronto mandates that all food trucks obtain a valid Municipal Licensing & Standards (ML&S) permit, which includes a health clearance from Toronto Public Health. This requirement ensures that food trucks meet specific health and safety standards to protect public health. The licensing process involves inspections that check for compliance with food safety, handling, and storage regulations. Failure to obtain a health license can result in fines, penalties, or even the closure of the food truck business.

**Trivia:** Toronto is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering a wide range of cuisines from around the world. Every summer, the city hosts a 'Food Truck Festival' where dozens of trucks gather, showcasing the city's vibrant and diverse culinary offerings.
