In Dubai, UAE, the legality of flying a drone without registering it depends on the type and purpose of the drone. According to the UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), all drones must be registered if they are used for commercial purposes or if they weigh more than 5 kilograms. For recreational drones under 5 kilograms, registration is not mandatory, but users must still adhere to specific flying guidelines set by the GCAA. These guidelines include not flying near airports, residential areas, or higher than 400 feet. Drone operators are also required to ensure that their drones do not invade personal privacy and must obtain permission to fly in certain areas.

**Trivia:** Dubai is known for its innovative use of drones in various sectors. One interesting project is the use of drones for taxi services, known as 'flying taxis', which is part of Dubai's Smart Autonomous Mobility Strategy aiming to transform 25% of total transportation in Dubai to autonomous mode by 2030.
