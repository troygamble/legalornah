In Amsterdam, as in the rest of the Netherlands, it is legal to ride an electric bike without wearing a helmet. This rule applies to standard electric bicycles (e-bikes) that assist the rider without completely replacing pedal power. These e-bikes are classified similarly to conventional bicycles and therefore do not require the rider to wear a helmet. However, for speed pedelecs, which are a faster class of electric bikes capable of speeds up to 45 km/h, helmets are mandatory. These are treated more like mopeds in terms of regulation, including the requirement for a helmet, a license plate, and a driving license.

**Trivia:** Amsterdam is famously bike-friendly, with more bicycles than residents. The city's infrastructure includes extensive bike lanes and special traffic lights for cyclists, making it one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world.
