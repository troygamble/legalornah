In Cape Town, South Africa, the legality of fishing without a license in coastal waters depends on the specific type of fishing and the area where it is conducted. Generally, recreational fishing in South Africa requires a permit or license, which can be obtained from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. These permits are necessary to regulate and manage fish populations, ensuring sustainable use of marine resources. The regulations might differ based on whether the fishing is from the shore or from a boat, and different species of fish may have specific rules.

**Trivia:** Cape Town is known for its rich marine biodiversity, and its coastal waters are home to a variety of fish species, making it a popular destination for both local and international anglers.
