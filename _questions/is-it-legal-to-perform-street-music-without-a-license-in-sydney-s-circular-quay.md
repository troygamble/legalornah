In Sydney, including the area of Circular Quay, the legality of performing street music without a license depends on specific local council regulations. The City of Sydney Council requires buskers to obtain a busking permit to perform in public spaces. These permits help manage public safety and amenity, ensuring that performances do not obstruct pedestrians or local businesses. Applicants must adhere to certain guidelines and may be required to audition to demonstrate that their performance is suitable for public spaces. Moreover, different locations within Sydney might have specific rules, and some areas could be designated as non-busking zones or have restricted performance times.

**Trivia:** Circular Quay is not only a hub for street performers but also a historical site where the first European settlers landed in Australia, making it a cultural landmark as well as a popular spot for both tourists and locals to enjoy live street performances.
