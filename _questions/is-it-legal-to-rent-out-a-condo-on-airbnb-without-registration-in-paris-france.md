In Paris, France, it is illegal to rent out a condo or any residential property on platforms like Airbnb without proper registration. The city requires owners to register with the town hall to obtain a registration number, which must be displayed on any online rental listings. This regulation is part of a broader effort to control the short-term rental market, which has been blamed for contributing to housing shortages and rising rents. The registration process includes verifying that the rental property complies with local housing standards and does not exceed the legal limit of 120 days of rental per year for a primary residence.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most stringent cities when it comes to Airbnb regulations. The city has even deployed a team of inspectors to crack down on illegal rentals, reflecting the significant impact of tourism on local housing markets.
