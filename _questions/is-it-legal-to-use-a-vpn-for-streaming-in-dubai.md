The legality of using a VPN for streaming in Dubai is not straightforward and depends on the purpose for which the VPN is used. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), including Dubai, has strict cyber laws that regulate the use of VPNs. According to the UAE's Telecommunications Regulatory Authority, the use of VPNs is legal as long as they are not utilized to commit crimes or to access services or content in a manner that violates the rights of licensing or service providers. Specifically, Federal Law No. 5 of 2012 on Combating Cybercrimes makes it illegal to use a VPN to commit a crime or prevent its discovery.

**Trivia:** Dubai is known for its strict internet censorship policies, blocking access to various websites and services. Interestingly, despite these restrictions, Dubai is also a major hub for technological innovation and digital transformation in the Middle East.
