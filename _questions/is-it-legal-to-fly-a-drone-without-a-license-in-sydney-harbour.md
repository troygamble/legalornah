Flying a drone in Sydney Harbour is subject to specific regulations governed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) of Australia. Drone pilots are generally required to follow the standard rules for flying drones, which include keeping the drone within visual line-of-sight, not flying over populous areas, and maintaining a certain distance from people and property. Furthermore, Sydney Harbour is a controlled airspace due to its proximity to Sydney Airport and its status as a location with high tourist traffic and significant landmarks. Therefore, flying a drone in this area often requires additional permissions or licenses, especially for commercial purposes or if the drone weighs more than 250 grams.

**Trivia:** Did you know that Sydney Harbour is home to the iconic Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge, and during special events like New Year's Eve, special drone light shows are sometimes organized as part of the celebrations?
