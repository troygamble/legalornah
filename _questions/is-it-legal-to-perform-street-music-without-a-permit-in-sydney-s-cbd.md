In Sydney's CBD, the legality of performing street music without a permit depends on specific local council regulations. The City of Sydney, for instance, requires buskers to obtain a permit to perform in public spaces. These permits are designed to manage the locations and times of performances, ensuring that they do not interfere with local businesses and pedestrian traffic. The application process typically involves an assessment of the performer's suitability and the nature of the performance, which helps maintain a certain standard and variety of street entertainment in the city.

**Trivia:** Sydney's busking scene is vibrant and diverse, often serving as a launching pad for emerging artists. Notably, some famous Australian musicians, including Tones and I, started their careers as street performers in Australian cities.
