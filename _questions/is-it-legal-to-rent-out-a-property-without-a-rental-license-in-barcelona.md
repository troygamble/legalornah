In Barcelona, it is illegal to rent out a property without a proper rental license. The city has specific regulations that require property owners to obtain a license before they can legally rent out their properties, especially for short-term rentals. This is primarily regulated to manage the impact of tourism on local housing availability and to ensure that rental properties meet certain safety and quality standards. The local government has been actively enforcing these regulations to curb illegal rentals, which can lead to significant fines for the property owners.

**Trivia:** Barcelona's strict rental regulations were partly introduced in response to the city's rising popularity as a tourist destination, which significantly increased the demand for short-term rental accommodations, impacting the availability and affordability of housing for local residents.
