In New York City, it is illegal to sell food without a valid health certificate. The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene requires all food service establishments to obtain a permit before they can operate. This includes restaurants, food trucks, and any other business selling food directly to consumers. The permit ensures that the establishment complies with local health codes and safety standards, which are designed to protect the public from foodborne illnesses and ensure sanitary conditions. Failure to obtain a health certificate can result in fines, closure of the establishment, and other legal penalties.

**Trivia:** New York City has some of the strictest food safety regulations in the United States. It was also one of the first cities to implement a letter grading system for restaurants, which informs the public about a restaurant's health inspection results.
