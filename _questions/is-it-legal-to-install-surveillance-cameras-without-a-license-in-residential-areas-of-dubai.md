In Dubai, the installation of surveillance cameras in residential areas is regulated under specific laws and guidelines to ensure privacy and security. The Dubai government requires that any installation of CCTV systems, whether in residential or commercial areas, comply with the regulations set by the Dubai Police. According to these regulations, individuals or entities must obtain a license from the Dubai Police's Security Industry Regulatory Agency (SIRA) before installing surveillance cameras. The process involves submitting a detailed application that includes the locations of the cameras and the purpose of their installation. The regulations are intended to protect individuals' privacy and prevent the misuse of surveillance technology.

**Trivia:** Dubai was one of the first cities in the Middle East to implement a city-wide surveillance system with thousands of CCTV cameras, significantly enhancing public security and monitoring.
