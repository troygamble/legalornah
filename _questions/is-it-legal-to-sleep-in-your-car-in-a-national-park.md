Whether or not you can legally sleep in your car in a national park depends on the specific regulations of each park. Generally, overnight sleeping in vehicles is only allowed in designated campgrounds or parking areas. Most national parks require visitors to pay for a camping permit if they wish to stay overnight. It is important to check the regulations of the specific national park you plan to visit as they can vary significantly. Additionally, some parks may have restrictions on the type of vehicles allowed for overnight stays, such as RVs or trailers, and may have specific rules about where these can be parked overnight.

**Trivia:** Did you know that some national parks offer 'Dark Sky' camping experiences where visitors can sleep in their vehicles or camp out under the stars to observe meteor showers and other celestial events without the interference of city lights?
