The legality of flying drones at night without special permission depends on the country and specific regulations governing the use of drones. In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires drone operators to obtain a Part 107 waiver if they wish to operate at night without meeting certain conditions. These conditions typically include having the drone equipped with anti-collision lighting visible for at least 3 statute miles. Additionally, drone operators must adhere to all other applicable regulations regarding airspace and the proximity to airports and other restricted areas.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first recorded use of a drone for combat purposes was in 1849, when Austria attacked Venice with unmanned balloons loaded with explosives?
