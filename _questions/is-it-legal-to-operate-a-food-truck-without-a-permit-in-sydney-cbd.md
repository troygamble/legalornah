In Sydney CBD, operating a food truck without a valid permit is illegal. The City of Sydney requires all food trucks to obtain a specific food truck permit before they can operate within the designated areas. This regulation ensures that all food trucks meet health, safety, and environmental standards, which are crucial for public safety and maintaining the city's cleanliness. The permit process involves several steps including food safety training, vehicle inspection, and approval of the menu and operating locations. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in fines, penalties, or even the closure of the food truck business.

**Trivia:** Sydney was one of the first cities in Australia to embrace the food truck culture, introducing a trial of gourmet food trucks back in 2012, which has since grown into a popular and vibrant part of the city's dining experience.
