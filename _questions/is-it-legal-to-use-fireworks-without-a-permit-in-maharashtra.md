In Maharashtra, the legality of using fireworks without a permit depends on several factors including the type of fireworks, the occasion, and local regulations. Generally, fireworks that are considered 'safe and sane' may not require a permit if used during traditional festive periods such as Diwali. However, for larger displays or the use of more hazardous fireworks, a permit is typically required. Local authorities in Maharashtra, such as the municipal corporations or police, have the authority to issue guidelines and permits for the use of fireworks. These regulations are primarily in place to ensure public safety and minimize environmental impact.

**Trivia:** Diwali, one of the biggest festivals in India and especially significant in Maharashtra, is famously associated with the use of fireworks. This festival, also known as the Festival of Lights, sees an extensive use of firecrackers and fireworks, creating spectacular displays across the skies.
