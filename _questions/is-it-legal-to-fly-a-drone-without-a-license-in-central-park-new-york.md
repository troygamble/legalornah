Flying a drone in Central Park, New York, is generally not allowed without a specific authorization or permit. New York City has stringent regulations regarding the use of drones in public spaces, primarily due to safety and privacy concerns. The New York City Administrative Code, under Title 10, Section 10-126, prohibits the takeoff and landing of drones within the city limits except at locations specifically designated by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation. As of now, Central Park is not designated as a permissible site for drone activities. Additionally, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates airspace and requires operators to follow certain guidelines, which include not flying drones in restricted zones such as near airports or certain government facilities, which can include major parks in urban settings.

**Trivia:** Did you know? Central Park has been a no-fly zone for drones partly because it is classified as Class B airspace due to its proximity to several major airports, including LaGuardia Airport. This classification means that the airspace is highly controlled to manage the potential risks associated with heavy air traffic.
