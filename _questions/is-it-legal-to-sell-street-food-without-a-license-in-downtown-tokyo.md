In Tokyo, as in most other cities in Japan, it is generally illegal to sell street food without the appropriate licenses. The city has strict regulations governing food safety, public health, and the use of public spaces. Vendors must obtain a food business license from the local ward office, which involves meeting specific health and safety standards, including proper food handling and sanitation practices. Additionally, depending on the location and type of food being sold, other permits related to fire safety and environmental protection might be required.

**Trivia:** In Tokyo, the famous Tsukiji Market, known for its fresh seafood and sushi, also hosts numerous street food vendors who must comply with stringent licensing rules to operate within or around the market area.
