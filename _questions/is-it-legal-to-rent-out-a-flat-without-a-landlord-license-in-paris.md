In Paris, whether you need a landlord license to rent out a flat depends on the type of rental and the duration. For long-term rentals, generally, a landlord license is not required. However, for short-term rentals, particularly those listed on platforms like Airbnb, the regulations are stricter. Parisian authorities require owners to register with the city and obtain a registration number. This number must be displayed in all advertisements for the rental property. Additionally, there is a cap on the number of days a property can be rented out short-term per year, which is currently set at 120 days. Owners must also ensure their property complies with zoning regulations and sometimes may need to convert their usage designation from residential to commercial, which involves obtaining a different type of permit.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on short-term rentals, largely to preserve residential housing availability. The city has even employed a team of inspectors to identify illegal rentals, reflecting the significant impact of tourism on its housing market.
