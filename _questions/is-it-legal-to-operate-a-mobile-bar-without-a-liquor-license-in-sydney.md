In Sydney, as in all of Australia, operating any business that sells or serves alcohol requires a liquor license. This requirement applies to mobile bars as well. The specific regulations governing the sale of alcohol are outlined in the Liquor Act 2007 (NSW), which mandates that any premises where liquor is sold, including mobile venues like food trucks or mobile bars, must have a valid liquor license issued by the New South Wales Government. The type of license required can vary depending on the nature of the service provided, such as whether the alcohol is consumed on-site or sold for takeaway.

**Trivia:** Did you know that Sydney once had strict 'lockout laws' that affected bars and pubs in key entertainment districts? These laws, which were designed to reduce alcohol-related violence, included restrictions on the times alcohol could be sold and consumed. They were largely repealed in 2020 due to public backlash and economic considerations.
