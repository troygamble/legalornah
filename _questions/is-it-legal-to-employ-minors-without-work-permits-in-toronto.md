In Toronto, as in the rest of Ontario, the employment of minors is regulated under the Employment Standards Act, 2000, which stipulates that minors aged 14 to 17 generally require a work permit to be legally employed during school hours. These permits are typically issued by the school the minor attends and are intended to ensure that the employment does not interfere with the minor's education. Outside of school hours, minors may work without a permit but are subject to restrictions on the type of work they can perform and the hours they can work. For example, there are specific regulations regarding hazardous work and night shifts to ensure the safety and well-being of minors in the workforce.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the concept of work permits for minors originated during the Industrial Revolution to prevent the exploitation of children in factories and mines? This was a significant shift towards the protection of children in the workforce.
