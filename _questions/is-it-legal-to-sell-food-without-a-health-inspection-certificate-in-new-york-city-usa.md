In New York City, it is illegal to sell food without a health inspection certificate. The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene requires that all food service establishments, including restaurants, cafes, and food carts, must pass a health inspection to ensure they meet local sanitary standards before they can operate legally. This inspection assesses various aspects of the establishment, including food handling, storage, and preparation processes, as well as employee hygiene and facility cleanliness. The purpose of this requirement is to protect public health by reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses.

**Trivia:** New York City's restaurant grading system, introduced in 2010, requires restaurants to display their health inspection grades prominently. These grades, which range from A to C, provide a quick visual indication of the establishment's compliance with health regulations, influencing dining decisions for many New Yorkers and tourists alike.
