In central Paris, France, the legality of performing street magic without a license depends on several factors, including the specific location and the nature of the performance. Generally, street performers, including magicians, are required to obtain a permit or authorization from local authorities to perform in public spaces. This is primarily to manage public order and safety, as well as to regulate the use of public areas for commercial purposes. The City of Paris has specific regulations that govern street performances, and these can vary by district. Performers must typically apply for a permit, which may involve providing personal information, details of the performance, and sometimes a demonstration of the act to ensure it meets community standards and safety guidelines.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its vibrant street art scene, including musicians, acrobats, and magicians, particularly in tourist-heavy areas like Montmartre and along the Seine River. The city's rich artistic culture has historically made it a hub for street performers from around the world.
