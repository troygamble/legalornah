In California, the use of recreational marijuana is legal for adults aged 21 and over. This was made possible by the passage of Proposition 64, also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, which voters approved in November 2016. Under this law, adults are allowed to possess, transport, purchase, consume, and share up to one ounce (28.5 grams) of marijuana and up to eight grams of concentrated marijuana. Additionally, individuals can cultivate up to six marijuana plants per residence for personal use, provided the cultivation area is secured and not visible from a public place.

**Trivia:** San Francisco, a city in California, was one of the first cities in the United States to establish a medical cannabis program, which was implemented in 1996, long before recreational marijuana was legalized.
