In central Paris, the legality of renting out residential property without a landlord license primarily depends on the duration and type of rental. For short-term rentals, particularly those listed on platforms like Airbnb, a registration number is required from the city authorities. This is part of a regulatory effort to manage the number of vacation rentals, which can impact local housing markets. Landlords must register with the city to obtain a number that must be displayed on any rental listing. For long-term rentals, a landlord license per se is not typically required, but landlords must comply with national and local housing codes and regulations, which include safety, health standards, and proper registration of rental contracts.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced stricter controls on short-term rental properties due to concerns that they were contributing to housing shortages and rising rents in central areas, affecting the availability of long-term rental housing for residents.
