In downtown Toronto, as in the rest of the city, operating a food truck without a health license is illegal. The City of Toronto mandates that all food trucks obtain a valid Municipal Licensing and Standards (MLS) permit, which includes an inspection and approval from Toronto Public Health. This process ensures that the food truck meets health and safety standards, which are critical for protecting the public from foodborne illnesses and ensuring sanitary conditions. The health license is part of the broader requirements that also include fire safety and zoning regulations, designed to maintain public health and safety in high-density areas like downtown Toronto.

**Trivia:** Toronto is known for its diverse food truck scene, reflecting the city's rich multicultural environment. Food trucks in Toronto offer a wide range of cuisines, from traditional Canadian dishes to international foods, making them a popular attraction at various festivals and events throughout the city.
