In Tokyo, Japan, the legality of flying a drone without registration depends on the weight of the drone and its intended use. Drones weighing 200 grams or more must be registered with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism before they can be legally flown. This registration process involves providing detailed information about the drone and its owner. Additionally, drone operators must adhere to specific regulations regarding where and how drones can be flown, which include restrictions on flying near airports, over populated areas, and at certain altitudes without prior permission.

**Trivia:** Japan was one of the first countries to establish a significant body of law specifically for drones, partly in response to an incident in 2015 where a drone carrying radioactive material landed on the roof of the Japanese Prime Minister's office.
