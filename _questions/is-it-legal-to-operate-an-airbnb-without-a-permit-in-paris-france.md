In Paris, France, operating a short-term rental property such as those offered through Airbnb requires adhering to specific local regulations and often necessitates obtaining a permit. Homeowners must register their property with the city, and the registration number must be displayed on any rental listing. This regulation is part of an effort to prevent housing shortages and maintain the availability of long-term rental properties. Additionally, there is a limitation on the number of days a property can be rented out on a short-term basis, which is capped at 120 days per year for primary residences. Properties designated as commercial can be rented out throughout the year but require different permits and are subject to additional regulations.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top cities for Airbnb listings worldwide, but it has also been at the forefront of implementing strict regulations to manage the impact of short-term rentals on its housing market and local communities.
