In Illinois, it is generally legal to turn right on a red light after coming to a complete stop, unless there is a sign explicitly prohibiting such a turn. Drivers must ensure that the way is clear and yield to pedestrians and other traffic before proceeding. Furthermore, this rule applies not only to intersections with traffic lights but also to red arrow signals, where drivers must follow the same stop and yield procedures before making a right turn.

**Trivia:** The practice of turning right on red was widely adopted in the U.S. during the 1970s as a measure to save fuel following the 1973 oil crisis.
