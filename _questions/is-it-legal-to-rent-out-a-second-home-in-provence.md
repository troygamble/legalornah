In Provence, as in the rest of France, it is generally legal to rent out a second home. Homeowners can rent their property on a short-term basis, typically as a vacation rental, or on a long-term lease. However, several regulations must be followed to ensure compliance with local and national laws. For short-term rentals, especially in tourist-heavy areas, homeowners may need to register the property with the local town hall, obtain a specific rental license, and ensure that their rental activities adhere to zoning regulations. For long-term rentals, landlords must adhere to the French rental laws which provide protection to tenants regarding lease terms, deposits, and eviction processes.

**Trivia:** Provence is famous for its lavender fields, which are in full bloom from the last week of June to the beginning of August. This picturesque scenery not only attracts tourists from around the world but also makes the region a popular spot for holiday homes and rentals.
