In Paris, France, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a health certificate. The health certificate is a mandatory requirement that ensures the food truck complies with hygiene and safety standards set by French health authorities. This certificate is part of a broader set of regulations aimed at safeguarding public health by preventing foodborne illnesses and maintaining high standards of food quality. The process of obtaining a health certificate involves a thorough inspection by health officials, who assess various aspects including the handling, storage, and preparation of food.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its gourmet food and high culinary standards, which extend even to its food trucks. The city hosts an annual 'Food Truck Festival,' celebrating the diverse and innovative food truck scene.
