In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, it is illegal to operate a food truck without obtaining the necessary health permits. The Food Sanitation Act of Japan mandates that any business involved in the preparation and sale of food must first secure a health permit from the local health authorities. This includes food trucks, which are subject to inspections ensuring that they meet specific hygiene standards, proper food handling practices, and appropriate waste disposal methods. Operating without these permits can result in significant fines, closure of the business, and potential criminal charges.

**Trivia:** Tokyo is known for its vibrant street food culture, and food trucks, locally known as 'yatai', have become increasingly popular, offering everything from traditional Japanese dishes to international cuisine. These mobile eateries are particularly famous during festivals and public events.
