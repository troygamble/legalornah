In Berlin, as in the rest of Germany, the legality of using a VPN for streaming movies primarily depends on the content being accessed and the terms of service of the streaming platform. Generally, using a VPN in itself is not illegal in Germany. However, using a VPN to access geo-restricted content that you do not have the legal rights to view, or to bypass copyright restrictions, can be considered a violation of copyright laws. Streaming services often have terms that restrict the use of techniques like VPNs to access their content from regions other than those specified in the user's agreement.

**Trivia:** Germany is known for its strict privacy laws and was one of the first countries to adopt data protection and privacy legislation, with the first act dating back to 1970 in the state of Hesse.
