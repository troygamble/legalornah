In Paris, whether you can rent out your home without a permit largely depends on the type of rental and the duration. For short-term rentals (less than a year for unfurnished and less than 90 days for furnished tourist rentals), the city regulations require homeowners to register with the town hall and obtain a registration number. This is especially stringent for rentals listed on platforms like Airbnb. If the property is your primary residence, you can rent it out for up to 120 days per year without needing a special permit, but registration is mandatory. For long-term rentals, different rules apply and generally do not require a permit, but must comply with French housing regulations regarding safety and the condition of the property.

**Trivia:** Paris has implemented these stringent measures on short-term rentals to combat the housing shortage in the city, which has been exacerbated by the popularity of platforms like Airbnb.
