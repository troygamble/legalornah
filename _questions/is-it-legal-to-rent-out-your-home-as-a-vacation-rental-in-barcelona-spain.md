In Barcelona, renting out your home as a vacation rental is regulated by local laws and requires adherence to specific regulations. Homeowners must obtain a license from the local government before listing their property as a short-term rental. This regulation is part of an effort to manage the influx of tourists and protect the local housing market. The city has imposed strict controls on the number of licenses issued to curb the impact on residential housing availability and community life. Without a proper license, renting out a property for short stays can lead to significant fines.

**Trivia:** Barcelona is known for its strict regulations on vacation rentals largely due to the city's struggle with overtourism, which has significantly affected the local residents' quality of life and contributed to increasing rental prices.
