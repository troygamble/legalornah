In Paris, including the Marais neighborhood, the legality of renting out a home without a permit largely depends on the duration and type of rental. For short-term rentals, specifically those less than 12 consecutive weeks per year, it is required by law to register the property with the city hall and obtain a registration number. This rule is part of an effort to regulate vacation rentals that compete with traditional hotels and to prevent the conversion of residential housing into full-time vacation rentals. Long-term rentals, on the other hand, are generally subject to less stringent regulations, but landlords must comply with national and local housing standards and regulations.

**Trivia:** The Marais is one of Paris's oldest neighborhoods and has been subject to many preservation and development laws aimed at maintaining its historical and cultural significance. This includes strict regulations on the types of alterations property owners can make to the facades and structures of buildings.
