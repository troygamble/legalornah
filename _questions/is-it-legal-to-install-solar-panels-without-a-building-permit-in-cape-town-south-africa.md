In Cape Town, South Africa, the legality of installing solar panels without a building permit depends on the specifics of the installation. Generally, smaller solar panel systems that are installed on existing structures and do not alter the structural integrity of the building may not require a building permit. However, larger installations or those that involve structural changes to the building will likely require a permit. The City of Cape Town has specific guidelines and regulations concerning the installation of solar panels. It is advised to consult with the local municipality or a professional to understand the specific requirements and to ensure compliance with local building codes and safety standards.

**Trivia:** Cape Town is known for its commitment to sustainability and renewable energy. The city has a goal to source 10% to 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, making solar panel installations a popular and supported initiative in the region.
