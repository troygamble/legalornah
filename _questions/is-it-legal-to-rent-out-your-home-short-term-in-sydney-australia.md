In Sydney, Australia, it is generally legal to rent out your home on a short-term basis, such as through platforms like Airbnb. However, there are specific regulations that homeowners must adhere to. The New South Wales government has set a 180-day cap in the Greater Sydney area for homes that are not the primary residence of the host. This means that if the host does not live in the property, it can only be rented out for up to 180 days per year on a short-term basis. Additionally, hosts are required to register their property with the NSW government and comply with local planning laws, which may vary from one area to another.

**Trivia:** Sydney is a popular destination for tourists, and the introduction of short-term rental regulations was partly in response to the need to balance the interests of local residents with those of visitors. The city's vibrant culture and iconic landmarks, such as the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, make it a prime location for short-term rentals.
