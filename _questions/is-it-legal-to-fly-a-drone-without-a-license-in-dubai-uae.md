In Dubai, the legality of flying a drone without a license depends on the purpose and specifications of the drone usage. For recreational use, individuals flying drones that weigh less than 250 grams may not require a license. However, for drones heavier than this, or if the drone is equipped with a camera or other recording devices, a registration and a license from the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) are mandatory. For commercial purposes, all drone operations must be licensed and registered with the DCAA. The regulations are strict to ensure safety, privacy, and security, with specific no-fly zones and operational guidelines that must be adhered to.

**Trivia:** Dubai is known for its innovative use of technology, including drones. The city has tested drones for various uses such as taxi services, delivering documents, and even for firefighting purposes.
