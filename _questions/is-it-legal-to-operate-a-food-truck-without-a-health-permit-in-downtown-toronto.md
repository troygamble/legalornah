In downtown Toronto, as in the rest of the city, operating a food truck requires adherence to specific health and safety regulations, which include obtaining a health permit. The City of Toronto mandates that all food trucks obtain a valid Municipal Licensing and Standards (MLS) permit, which ensures that the food truck meets local health standards to protect public health. This permit is issued only after a thorough inspection by city health inspectors, who check for compliance with food safety, handling, and storage regulations. Without this health permit, a food truck operation is considered illegal and can be subject to fines and closure.

**Trivia:** Toronto's diverse food truck scene reflects the city's multicultural population. At various food truck festivals, one can find a wide range of cuisines, from traditional Canadian dishes to international flavors, showcasing Toronto's reputation as one of the most multicultural cities in the world.
