In Paris, France, the legality of renting out a property on Airbnb without a license is conditional. According to French law, individuals who wish to rent out their primary residence on platforms like Airbnb can do so for up to 120 days per year without a special license. However, this is only applicable if the property is the host's main residence, meaning they live there for at least eight months of the year. For properties that are not the primary residence, or if renting out for more than 120 days a year, hosts must register the property with the city and obtain a commercial license. This registration process involves converting the residential status of the property into commercial, which can be complex and is subject to approval from local authorities.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top cities for Airbnb listings worldwide, and the city's measures to regulate short-term rentals were partly aimed at addressing concerns over rising property prices and the availability of long-term rental housing.
