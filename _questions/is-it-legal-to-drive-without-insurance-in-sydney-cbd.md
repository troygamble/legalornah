In Sydney CBD, as in all parts of New South Wales and indeed Australia, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without having at least compulsory third-party (CTP) insurance. This type of insurance is required by law and is designed to cover the driver for any legal liability for injury or death to third parties in the event of an accident. Known commonly as 'Green Slip' in New South Wales, CTP insurance must be obtained before you can register your vehicle. Driving without this insurance, or allowing your vehicle's registration to lapse (which includes the CTP insurance), is considered a serious offense and can lead to hefty fines, demerit points, and even the suspension of your driver's license.

**Trivia:** The term 'Green Slip' comes from the original color of the form used for CTP insurance in New South Wales. Despite changes over time, the name has stuck and continues to be used colloquially to refer to compulsory third-party insurance.
