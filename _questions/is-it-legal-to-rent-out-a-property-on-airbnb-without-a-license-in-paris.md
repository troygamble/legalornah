In Paris, renting out property on Airbnb without a license is subject to specific regulations and may require a registration number. The city of Paris mandates that any short-term rental property, such as those listed on Airbnb, must be registered with the local authorities. This registration helps the city enforce its regulations on short-term rentals, which are intended to prevent a shortage of long-term rental properties and ensure compliance with local housing laws. Property owners must declare their intent to rent out their property on a short-term basis and obtain a registration number, which must be displayed on any online listings.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top cities in the world for Airbnb listings, reflecting its status as a major tourist destination. The city's legal framework for short-term rentals has evolved as a response to the significant impact that platforms like Airbnb have had on the local housing market and hotel industry.
