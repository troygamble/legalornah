In New York City, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. New York State law requires individuals who wish to carry a concealed firearm to obtain a permit through a rigorous application process that involves background checks and, in some cases, a demonstration of specific need for a firearm. This permit process is especially stringent in New York City, which has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States. The New York City Administrative Code and state law both mandate that carrying a concealed weapon without the appropriate licensing is a criminal offense, potentially resulting in severe penalties including fines and imprisonment.

**Trivia:** New York City's strict gun laws can be traced back to the Sullivan Act of 1911, one of the first gun control laws in the United States, which was enacted after a famous shooting involving a gambler and a musician in 1909.
