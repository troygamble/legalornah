In New York City, as in the rest of New York State, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without having auto insurance. State law mandates that all motor vehicles registered in the state must have liability insurance. The minimum insurance coverage required includes $25,000 for bodily injury to one person, $50,000 for bodily injury to all persons, and $10,000 for property damage in any one accident. Additionally, New York operates under a 'no-fault' insurance system, which means that each driver's insurance must cover their own injuries and damages regardless of who caused the accident, up to a certain limit.

**Trivia:** New York was the first state in the U.S. to require automobile liability insurance. This law came into effect in 1956, setting a precedent for other states to follow.
