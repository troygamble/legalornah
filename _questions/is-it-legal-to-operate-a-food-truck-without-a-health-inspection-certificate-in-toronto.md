In Toronto, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health inspection certificate. The City of Toronto mandates that all food service establishments, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, must comply with the Toronto Public Healthâ€™s food safety regulations. These regulations are designed to ensure that food served to the public is safe and handled in a hygienic manner. A health inspection certificate is issued following an inspection that assesses compliance with these standards, including proper food storage, handling, and preparation practices.

**Trivia:** Toronto is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering a wide range of cuisines from around the world. This culinary diversity is celebrated annually at various food truck festivals throughout the city.
