In Sydney, operating a food truck without a health certificate is illegal. All food businesses, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, are required to adhere to the Food Standards Code, which mandates that they obtain a health certificate from local authorities, in this case, the City of Sydney Council. This certificate ensures that the food truck meets specific health standards and that the food served is safe for public consumption. The process involves initial and periodic inspections of the food truck to check for compliance with food safety regulations, proper food handling, and sanitation practices.

**Trivia:** Sydney's food truck scene is vibrant and diverse, reflecting the city's multicultural population. In 2012, the City of Sydney launched a trial program to introduce food trucks as a new dining option in the city, which has since become a popular fixture in Sydney's culinary landscape.
