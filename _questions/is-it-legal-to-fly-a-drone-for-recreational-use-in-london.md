Flying a drone for recreational purposes in London is subject to specific regulations and restrictions, primarily governed by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Drone operators must adhere to the Drone Code which includes rules such as keeping the drone within visual line of sight, not flying above 400 feet, and staying away from airports and airfields. Additionally, certain areas of London are classified as 'no-fly zones' due to security or privacy concerns, including areas around airports, government buildings, and military installations. It is essential for drone operators to check the latest regulations and local laws before flying a drone in any specific area of London.

**Trivia:** London's Heathrow Airport, one of the busiest in the world, has experienced several drone sightings that led to major disruptions, including a significant incident in December 2018 that caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled.
