In downtown Toronto, the legality of renting out a condo without a permit largely depends on the specific regulations set by the condominium corporation and the municipal bylaws. Most condominiums have their own set of rules which may require owners to obtain permission or a permit from the condo board before leasing their units. Additionally, the City of Toronto has regulations that may affect short-term rentals, such as those listed on platforms like Airbnb, which require owners to register with the city and obtain a valid permit. For long-term rentals, while a city permit may not be necessary, compliance with the condominium's rules and the Residential Tenancies Act is required.

**Trivia:** Toronto's condominium market is one of the most active in North America, with the city often called the 'condo capital of North America' due to its high number of high-rise residential buildings.
