In San Francisco, as in the rest of the United States, whether you need to register a drone with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) depends primarily on the weight of the drone and its intended use. Drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) must be registered with the FAA before they can be flown outdoors. This registration is necessary for both recreational (hobbyist) and commercial (non-hobbyist) use. For drones under 0.55 pounds, FAA registration is not required unless they are used in a way that requires adherence to the Part 107 guidelines, such as commercial operations.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first FAA-approved drone delivery in the United States occurred in 2016? A drone delivered medical supplies to a rural health clinic in Virginia, marking a significant milestone in the use of drones for commercial purposes.
