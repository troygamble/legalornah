In Sydney, as in the rest of Australia, the legality of flying a drone without a license depends on several factors including the weight of the drone and the purpose of the flight. Drones weighing under 2 kilograms used for recreational purposes do not require a license if flown in accordance with the safety rules set by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). These rules include not flying the drone higher than 120 meters, keeping it within visual line-of-sight, and not operating it near emergency operations, in populous areas, or closer than 30 meters to people. However, for commercial purposes, or if the drone weighs more than 2 kilograms, a Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) is required, along with an operatorâ€™s certificate, regardless of the area of operation.

**Trivia:** Australia was one of the first countries to regulate the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for commercial purposes, starting in 2002. Sydney, known for its scenic beauty and landmarks like the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge, is a popular location for aerial photography using drones.
