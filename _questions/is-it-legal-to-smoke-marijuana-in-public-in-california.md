In California, it is illegal to smoke marijuana in public spaces. The state's laws, specifically under Proposition 64, allow the possession and private use of marijuana for individuals over the age of 21, but public consumption remains prohibited. This includes smoking, vaping, or ingesting cannabis in places such as streets, parks, and public buildings. Violations can result in fines and penalties, varying depending on the locality and the specific circumstances of the offense. Law enforcement agencies are tasked with enforcing these regulations, and local governments may have additional rules further restricting public use.

**Trivia:** Interestingly, while California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996, it took over two decades before it legalized marijuana for recreational use in 2016.
