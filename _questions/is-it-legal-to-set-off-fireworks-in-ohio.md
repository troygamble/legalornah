In Ohio, the legality of setting off fireworks depends on the type of fireworks and the regulations specific to the local jurisdiction. Consumer fireworks, commonly known as 1.4G fireworks, can be purchased by individuals over the age of 18. However, without a permit, these fireworks can only be used on private property with the property owner's permission and cannot be discharged within city limits or in public parks.

**Trivia:** Ohio is known for hosting one of the largest fireworks displays in the Midwest, called 'Red, White, and Boom!' which takes place in Columbus on the Fourth of July.
