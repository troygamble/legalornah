In Paris, whether you can legally rent out a home without a license primarily depends on the duration and purpose of the rental. For short-term rentals, specifically those less than 120 days per year, it is required by law to register the property with the city authorities. This registration process involves obtaining a registration number that must be displayed on all rental advertisements. The law aims to regulate the short-term rental market, particularly impacting platforms like Airbnb, to ensure housing availability for residents and control rental prices. For long-term rentals, the regulations are less stringent regarding licensing, but landlords must comply with French rental laws, which cover aspects like lease agreements, tenant rights, and property standards.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stringent measures on short-term rentals largely in response to the rising concerns over the availability of affordable housing and the effects of tourism on local neighborhoods. These regulations have set a precedent, influencing other popular tourist cities worldwide to implement similar laws.
