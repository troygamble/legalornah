In downtown Tokyo, the legality of renting out your home for short-term stays without registration depends on compliance with Japan's Minpaku law, which governs private lodging services. Under this law, homeowners must register with local authorities before listing their property for short-term rental, typically defined as stays shorter than six months. This registration process includes meeting specific safety and health standards, and obtaining permission from local governments. Additionally, there are restrictions on the number of days per year a property can be rented out, which is capped at 180 days. Homeowners must also adhere to local regulations, which can vary between different wards or districts within Tokyo.

**Trivia:** The Minpaku law was introduced in 2018 in response to the rising popularity of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, especially leading up to the Tokyo Olympics, to address concerns related to safety, noise, and the impact on residential communities.
