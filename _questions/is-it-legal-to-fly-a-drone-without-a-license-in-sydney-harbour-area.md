In Sydney Harbour, the legality of flying a drone without a license largely depends on the type of drone and its intended use. For recreational purposes, drones weighing under 2kg can generally be flown without a license, provided they adhere to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) safety rules. These rules include not flying the drone higher than 120 meters, keeping it within visual line-of-sight, and not operating it over populous areas where it could pose a risk to people. However, for commercial purposes or for drones weighing over 2kg, a license and/or additional permissions from CASA are required. Furthermore, Sydney Harbour has specific no-fly zones and restrictions due to its proximity to heliports and its status as a security-sensitive area.

**Trivia:** Did you know? The Sydney Harbour Bridge is a popular but strictly regulated area for drone flying due to its iconic status and heavy traffic, both pedestrian and vehicular. Special permission is often required to fly a drone in this area.
