In New York City, it is illegal to operate a food truck without undergoing a health inspection. The NYC Health Code requires all mobile food vending units, including food trucks, to possess a valid permit issued by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). This permit ensures that the food truck meets specific health and safety standards designed to protect the public. The process includes an inspection of the food truck to check for compliance with food safety regulations, proper waste disposal, and overall cleanliness. Operating a food truck without this permit, which is only issued after a satisfactory health inspection, can result in fines, legal action, and the potential closure of the food truck.

**Trivia:** Food trucks in New York City are often subjected to more frequent health inspections than traditional restaurants due to their mobile nature and limited space, which can present unique challenges in maintaining food safety standards.
