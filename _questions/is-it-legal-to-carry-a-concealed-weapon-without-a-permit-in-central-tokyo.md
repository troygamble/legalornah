In Japan, particularly in central Tokyo, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. Japanese law is very strict regarding the possession and carrying of weapons, governed by the Firearms and Swords Control Law. This legislation strictly prohibits the possession, use, purchase, or sale of firearms and swords without proper authorization. Permits are rarely granted, and the criteria for obtaining one are stringent, typically limited to individuals in professions requiring such tools, like certain traditional craftsmen or sportspeople involved in shooting sports.

**Trivia:** Japan has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world, largely due to its rigorous laws concerning gun control. In fact, most police officers in Japan rarely carry firearms.
