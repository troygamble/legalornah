In New York City, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health permit. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene requires all food service establishments, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, to obtain a permit to ensure they meet local health codes and food safety regulations. This permit process involves an inspection of the food truck to ensure compliance with hygiene, safety, and operational standards. Operating a food truck without this permit can result in fines, legal action, and the possible closure of the business.

**Trivia:** New York City is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering an array of foods ranging from traditional American hot dogs to international cuisines. The city's first food truck dates back to the late 1600s when street vendors sold food from push carts.
