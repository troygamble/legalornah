In central Paris, it is generally required to register a property with the local authorities before renting it out on platforms like Airbnb. This registration process helps the city manage and regulate short-term rentals, ensuring they comply with local housing laws and zoning regulations. Property owners must obtain a registration number and display it in their listing. The city of Paris has imposed strict rules to prevent the conversion of residential housing into full-time vacation rentals, which can affect the local rental market and housing availability. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top tourist destinations in the world, and it has implemented these regulations partly to preserve the character and accessibility of residential neighborhoods amidst the tourism boom.
