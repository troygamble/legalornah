In Toronto, as in the rest of Canada, the sale of homemade cosmetics is regulated by Health Canada under the Food and Drugs Act and the Cosmetic Regulations. These regulations require that all cosmetics sold in Canada, including homemade ones, must be safe for use and properly labeled. Manufacturers and sellers must notify Health Canada about each cosmetic product they plan to sell in Canada by submitting a Cosmetic Notification Form prior to sale. This form includes information about the ingredients and their concentrations. Although formal certification is not required, compliance with these regulations is mandatory to ensure product safety and proper labeling. Failure to comply can result in products being denied entry into the market or removed from sale if they are found to be unsafe or improperly labeled.

**Trivia:** The global cosmetic products market was valued at approximately $532 billion in 2017 and is expected to reach over $800 billion by 2023, showing the massive scale and potential of the industry, including for small-scale and homemade cosmetic vendors.
