In Birmingham, UK, as in the rest of the United Kingdom, it is illegal to drive a vehicle on public roads without at least third-party motor insurance. This requirement is mandated by the Road Traffic Act 1988. Third-party insurance is the minimum level of cover required and it protects against claims of damage or injury to another driver, passenger, or pedestrian caused by the fault of the insured driver. Driving without insurance is considered a serious offense and can result in penalties including fines, points on the driver's license, and in some cases, disqualification from driving.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the concept of insurance dates back to ancient times? The Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous Code of Hammurabi, around 1754 BC, and was practiced by early Mediterranean sailing merchants. If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender's guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen.
