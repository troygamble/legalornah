In Tokyo, Japan, the legality of parking a commercial vehicle overnight in residential areas depends on specific local regulations and the type of commercial vehicle. Generally, Tokyo has strict parking laws aimed at reducing congestion and maintaining public order in residential neighborhoods. Commercial vehicles, especially larger trucks and vans, may face restrictions that prevent them from parking overnight in certain residential zones unless they have a specific permit or are using designated parking facilities. These regulations are enforced to minimize noise, pollution, and traffic disturbances that can affect the quality of life in residential areas.

**Trivia:** Tokyo is known for its efficient use of space, including multi-level parking lots and automated parking systems. This efficiency is partly a response to the limited space available in such a densely populated city, influencing how and where vehicles, including commercial ones, can park.
