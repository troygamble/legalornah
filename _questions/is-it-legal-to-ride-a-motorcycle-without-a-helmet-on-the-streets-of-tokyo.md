In Tokyo, as well as throughout Japan, it is illegal to ride a motorcycle without wearing a helmet. This regulation is enforced under the Japanese Road Traffic Law, which mandates that all motorcycle riders and passengers must wear helmets that comply with safety standards set by the government. The law is designed to protect riders from head injuries in the event of an accident, which are significantly more common and severe among motorcyclists than car occupants. Violating this law can result in penalties, including fines and points on the driver's license.

**Trivia:** Japan was one of the first countries to introduce a mandatory helmet law for both motorcycle drivers and passengers. This regulation has been credited with significantly reducing the number of head injuries and fatalities among motorcyclists in Japan.
