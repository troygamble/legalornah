In Japan, flying a drone in central Tokyo without a permit is generally prohibited due to strict regulations aimed at ensuring safety and privacy. The Japanese government has designated specific no-fly zones, particularly in densely populated areas and near sensitive locations such as government buildings, airports, and military installations. Central Tokyo, being a highly urbanized area with numerous such facilities, falls under these restrictions. Drone operators must obtain permission from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) if they wish to fly in restricted zones, and they are required to adhere to specific operational guidelines that include maintaining a certain distance from people and buildings and not flying above a designated altitude.

**Trivia:** In Tokyo, the use of drones has been creatively embraced beyond recreational or photography purposes. For instance, during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, a spectacular drone display was used during the opening ceremony, featuring hundreds of drones forming the shape of the Earth, symbolizing unity and technological innovation.
