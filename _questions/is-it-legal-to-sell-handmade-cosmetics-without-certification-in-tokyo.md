In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the sale of handmade cosmetics is regulated under the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act (PMDA). According to this act, any product classified as a cosmetic must meet specific safety and labeling standards before it can be sold commercially. Manufacturers of cosmetics, including small-scale or handmade producers, must ensure their products do not contain prohibited substances and are manufactured in a way that ensures they are safe for consumer use. Additionally, certain products may require safety testing and approval before they can be marketed. Therefore, while it is possible to sell handmade cosmetics, compliance with these regulations is mandatory.

**Trivia:** In Japan, the cosmetics industry is highly innovative, often leading the global market in trends and technology. For instance, Japan was one of the pioneers in developing and popularizing sheet masks, which have become a staple in skincare routines worldwide.
