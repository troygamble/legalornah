In Japan, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without car insurance. Specifically, all drivers are required to have at least compulsory automobile liability insurance (CALI), known in Japanese as 'Jibaiseki'. This insurance covers the costs associated with bodily injuries caused to others in the event of an accident, but it does not cover damage to your own vehicle or other people's property. For comprehensive coverage, drivers must purchase optional vehicle insurance, often referred to as voluntary insurance. Driving without the mandatory CALI in downtown Tokyo, or anywhere in Japan, can result in severe penalties including fines and suspension of the driver's license.

**Trivia:** Japan's compulsory automobile liability insurance system was established in 1955, reflecting the country's commitment to ensuring that victims of road traffic accidents can receive compensation, which underscores the government's approach to road safety and driver responsibility.
