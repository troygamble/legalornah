In downtown Toronto, as in the rest of Canada, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. Canadian law, governed by the Criminal Code of Canada and the Firearms Act, strictly controls the possession, transport, and carrying of firearms and other weapons. Individuals must possess a valid Possession and Acquisition License (PAL) to own firearms, and carrying a concealed weapon typically requires an additional Restricted Possession and Acquisition License (RPAL) along with an Authorization to Carry (ATC) permit, which is rarely issued and generally restricted to those who need protection from threats of physical harm.

**Trivia:** Canada's gun laws are considered some of the strictest in the world, especially when compared to its southern neighbor, the United States. The process to legally acquire and carry a concealed firearm in Canada involves a thorough background check, a mandatory safety course, and specific justifications for why carrying a concealed weapon is necessary.
