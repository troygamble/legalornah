Using a VPN to stream Netflix in Berlin falls into a legal gray area. While there is no specific law in Germany that prohibits the use of VPNs for accessing geo-restricted content, the situation regarding streaming services like Netflix is more complex. Netflix's terms of use explicitly state that users should only access the service in the country where they have established an account and only from territories where Netflix offers its service. The use of VPNs to circumvent geographical restrictions violates these terms. However, breaking Netflix's terms of service is not inherently illegal but can lead to the termination of the user's account.

**Trivia:** Germany has one of the highest concentrations of VPN users in the world, largely due to the country's strict privacy laws and the general public's concern over internet privacy.
