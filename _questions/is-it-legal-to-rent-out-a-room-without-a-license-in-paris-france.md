In Paris, France, the legality of renting out a room without a license depends on several factors, including the duration of the rental and the type of accommodation. For short-term rentals (less than 120 days per year), individuals are allowed to rent out their primary residence without a specific license. However, they must register the rental with the city hall and obtain a registration number. This number must be displayed in all rental advertisements. For rentals longer than 120 days or for properties that are not the owner's primary residence, a commercial license may be required, and the property might need to be converted officially into a commercial space.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on short-term rentals, largely due to concerns about housing shortages and the preservation of residential spaces. The city has implemented measures such as requiring landlords to register their rental properties and limiting the number of days a property can be rented out to tourists, which has led to numerous legal battles with platforms like Airbnb.
