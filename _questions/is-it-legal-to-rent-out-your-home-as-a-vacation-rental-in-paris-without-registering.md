In Paris, it is illegal to rent out your home as a vacation rental without first registering it with the city authorities. This regulation was implemented to manage the rising number of homes being used for short-term rentals, which has been linked to housing shortages and increased rental prices for local residents. Homeowners must obtain a registration number and display it in all rental advertisements. Failure to comply with these rules can result in hefty fines. The city uses this system to ensure that properties are not rented out for more than 120 days per year, which is the legal limit for primary residences.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on vacation rentals, partly due to its status as one of the world's top tourist destinations. The city has even employed a team of inspectors to track down illegal rentals, reflecting how seriously it takes this issue.
