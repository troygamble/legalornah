In Mumbai, as in other parts of India, the legality of installing surveillance cameras in residential areas without consent depends on various factors including location, purpose, and privacy considerations. The Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Indian Penal Code provide a legal framework that protects individuals' privacy. Surveillance cameras installed in public areas for security purposes are generally permissible. However, installing cameras in a manner that invades personal privacy, such as in private spaces without the consent of the individuals concerned, is illegal. Consent of the residents is crucial when the cameras are directed towards private areas such as inside homes or other private premises.

**Trivia:** India has a burgeoning market for surveillance technology, and Mumbai, being a major urban center, has seen a significant rise in the use of CCTV cameras not only for security but also for managing traffic and public behavior.
