In Miami, Florida, as in the rest of the state, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without having car insurance. Florida law requires all drivers to carry a minimum amount of car insurance to ensure that they can cover the costs associated with damages or injuries caused in an auto accident. Specifically, Florida requires drivers to have personal injury protection (PIP) and property damage liability (PDL) insurance. PIP covers medical, disability, and funeral expenses for the policyholder, regardless of fault, up to the limits of the policy, while PDL pays for damages to other people's property caused by the policyholder in an accident.

**Trivia:** Florida is known as a 'no-fault' state, meaning that after a car accident, each party's own insurance coverage is used to cover their losses, regardless of who was at fault for causing the accident. This system is intended to reduce the number of lawsuits filed over auto accidents.
