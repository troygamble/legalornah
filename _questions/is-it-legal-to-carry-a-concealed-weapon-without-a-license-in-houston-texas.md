In Houston, Texas, it is generally illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Under Texas law, individuals are required to obtain a License to Carry (LTC) if they wish to carry handguns either openly or concealed. The LTC process includes a background check, fingerprinting, and a training course that covers gun safety and laws concerning the use of force. Carrying a concealed handgun without an LTC can result in criminal charges, including misdemeanors or felonies, depending on the circumstances and the individual's criminal history.

**Trivia:** Texas was one of the last states to allow the open carry of handguns. It wasn't until 2016 that open carry became legal for those with a concealed carry license.
