In Mumbai, as in other parts of India, selling food from home generally requires adherence to certain health and safety regulations, which include obtaining relevant licenses and certificates. The primary regulation governing this activity is the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSSAI). According to this act, any individual or entity involved in the manufacturing, processing, distribution, and sale of food products must register with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and obtain a food safety license or registration depending on the scale of their business. This process ensures that the food meets safety standards and is fit for consumption. Small-scale or occasional sellers might qualify for simpler registration procedures, but a health certificate or similar documentation reflecting compliance with local health codes is typically required.

**Trivia:** Mumbai is known for its vibrant street food culture, which includes local favorites like Vada Pav and Pav Bhaji. Despite the informal nature of many such food vendors, regulations require even street vendors to adhere to certain health and safety standards.
