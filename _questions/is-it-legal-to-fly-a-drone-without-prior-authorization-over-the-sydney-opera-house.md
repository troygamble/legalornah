Flying a drone over the Sydney Opera House without prior authorization is generally illegal. This area is classified as a no-fly zone under Australian drone regulations enforced by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). The Sydney Opera House is not only a highly populated tourist destination but also located near other critical infrastructure such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge, making it subject to stricter aerial surveillance and safety protocols. Drone operators are required to adhere to specific safety rules, which include not flying in or near restricted areas without explicit permission from relevant authorities.

**Trivia:** The Sydney Opera House is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings, designed by architect JÃ¸rn Utzon. Its unique sail-like design makes it particularly popular for aerial photography, which increases the temptation and attempts to fly drones over it.
