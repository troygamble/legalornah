In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, operating a food truck requires adherence to specific health and safety regulations, including the possession of a valid health inspection certificate. The Food Sanitation Act of Japan mandates that any business involved in the sale of food and beverages must be inspected and receive a certificate from local health authorities. This certificate ensures that the food truck meets the necessary hygienic standards to safely serve food to the public. Without this certificate, a food truck operation is considered illegal and can be subject to fines, closure, or other penalties by health inspectors.

**Trivia:** Tokyo is known for its vibrant street food culture, including food trucks (known locally as 'kitchen cars') that offer a wide range of culinary delights, from traditional Japanese dishes to international cuisine. These mobile eateries are particularly popular during festivals and in areas with high foot traffic, such as near office buildings and tourist spots.
