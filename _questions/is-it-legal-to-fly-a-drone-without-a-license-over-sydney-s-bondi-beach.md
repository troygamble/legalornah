In Australia, the legality of flying a drone over Sydney's Bondi Beach depends on several factors, including the type of drone, its use, and adherence to regulations set by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). For recreational drone use, CASA requires that drones not be flown in a way that creates a hazard to another aircraft, person, or property. Additionally, drones must not be flown over populous areas such as beaches, parks, or sports ovals where the operation of the drone poses a risk to public safety. Commercial drone operators must have a Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) and operate under an RPA operator's certificate (ReOC) or excluded category, depending on the size of the drone and the nature of the operation.

**Trivia:** Bondi Beach is not only famous for its beautiful views and surfing but also for being a hotspot for drone photographers, especially during the Sculpture by the Sea exhibition, which turns the coastal walk into an outdoor gallery.
