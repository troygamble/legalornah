In Sydney, Australia, the legality of renting out a home on Airbnb without a specific license depends on various factors, including the location of the property and the duration of the rental. New South Wales (NSW), where Sydney is located, has implemented state-wide regulations that affect short-term rental accommodations. Hosts are generally allowed to rent out their homes for up to 180 days per year if they are not present. However, if the property is located in a strata scheme, the strata by-laws might prohibit short-term rentals altogether or require specific conditions to be met. Additionally, local councils may have their own regulations that could impact the legality of such rentals.

**Trivia:** Airbnb was first launched in 2008 and by 2022, it has listings in over 100,000 cities and towns worldwide, including Sydney, which is known for its iconic landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge.
