Flying a drone without prior authorization over Sydney Harbour is generally prohibited under Australian aviation regulations. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) oversees drone regulations in Australia and has designated Sydney Harbour as a 'no-fly zone' for recreational drone operators due to its proximity to heliports and its status as a highly secure area. This restriction is intended to prevent incidents that could endanger public safety or interfere with air traffic. Commercial operators can apply for permissions, but they must meet stringent requirements and demonstrate that their operations will not pose a safety risk.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is not only famous for its scenic beauty but also hosts one of the world's largest natural harbours. It is a popular location for New Year's Eve celebrations, featuring a spectacular fireworks display that is often captured by professional drone operators under special authorization.
