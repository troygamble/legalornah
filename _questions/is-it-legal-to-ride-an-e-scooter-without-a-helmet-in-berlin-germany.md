In Berlin, Germany, it is legal to ride an e-scooter without a helmet. The German road traffic regulations (StVO) do not mandate the use of helmets while riding e-scooters. However, they do require that all e-scooters must comply with certain technical specifications and be officially approved for road use. Riders must adhere to specific rules, such as using bicycle lanes where available and not exceeding the speed limit of 20 kilometers per hour. While helmets are not legally required, the German Road Safety Council (DVR) strongly recommends wearing them to increase safety and reduce the risk of head injuries in case of accidents.

**Trivia:** Germany officially legalized e-scooters in June 2019, and since then, they have become a popular mode of transportation in urban areas, offering a quick and environmentally friendly alternative to cars and public transport.
