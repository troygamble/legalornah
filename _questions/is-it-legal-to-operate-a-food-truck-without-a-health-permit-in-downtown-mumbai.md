In Mumbai, as in most cities in India, operating a food truck or any food business requires adherence to certain health and safety regulations. The primary regulatory framework that governs the operation of food trucks in Mumbai involves obtaining necessary permits from the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). This includes a health permit, which ensures that the food truck meets the hygiene standards set forth by the local health department. Without this health permit, a food truck is considered to be operating illegally and can be subject to fines or closures by health inspectors.

**Trivia:** Food trucks in Mumbai offer a diverse array of cuisines reflecting the city's rich cultural diversity, from traditional Maharashtrian dishes to international foods, making them a popular choice among locals and tourists alike.
