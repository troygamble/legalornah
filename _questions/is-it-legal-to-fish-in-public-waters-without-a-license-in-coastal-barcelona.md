In coastal Barcelona, as in the rest of Spain, it is generally illegal to fish in public waters without a valid fishing license. The requirement for a fishing license is mandated by both national and regional laws aimed at managing and conserving fish stocks and marine ecosystems. These licenses are issued by the regional government, in this case, the Generalitat de Catalunya, and are required for both recreational and commercial fishing. The licensing system helps to regulate the number of fishers, the types of fish that can be caught, and the methods used, thus ensuring sustainable fishing practices.

**Trivia:** Barcelona is not just popular for its cultural heritage but also for its rich maritime history. The city's proximity to the Mediterranean Sea has made it a hub for fishing activities for centuries, influencing local cuisine and culture. One of the famous dishes, 'Zarzuela', is a testament to this, being a delicious seafood medley that showcases the variety of seafood available in the region.
