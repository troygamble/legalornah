In Tokyo, Japan, the legality of flying a drone over residential areas depends on several factors, including the specific location, the time, and the purpose of the drone flight. Japan's national regulations, governed by the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, generally restrict drone flights in densely populated areas unless prior permission has been obtained. This includes residential zones in major cities like Tokyo. Drone operators must avoid flying over crowds or areas where events are taking place, and flying near airports is strictly regulated.

**Trivia:** Tokyo has specific 'No-Fly Zones' for drones, which include areas around important government buildings and facilities, as well as around the Imperial Palace. The city also hosts annual events where drone enthusiasts can learn more about the regulations and advancements in drone technology.
