The legality of using a VPN to stream Netflix in Sydney's CBD, or anywhere in Australia, primarily depends on the purpose and manner of the VPN use. In Australia, there are no specific laws that prohibit the use of VPN technology itself, as it is a legal tool that provides privacy and security online. However, using a VPN to access Netflix content that is geo-restricted can violate Netflix's terms of service. Netflix actively discourages the use of VPNs to bypass geographical restrictions and has implemented measures to detect and block VPN users. While this is not illegal under Australian law, it can lead to the suspension or termination of your Netflix account.

**Trivia:** Netflix uses sophisticated technology to detect and block IP addresses associated with VPN servers. Despite these efforts, many VPN providers continually update their services to evade detection, turning it into a constant game of cat and mouse between Netflix and VPN providers.
