In Barcelona, particularly in the Gothic Quarter, it is illegal to rent out an apartment on platforms like Airbnb without proper registration. The city has implemented strict regulations to control short-term rentals, primarily to address concerns over tourism's impact on local housing markets and community life. Landlords must obtain a tourist license from the city council, which has been increasingly difficult to acquire as Barcelona has put a cap on the number of licenses issued in an effort to curb the proliferation of short-term rentals. This measure is part of a broader strategy to maintain the availability of residential housing and preserve the character of neighborhoods heavily impacted by tourism.

**Trivia:** Barcelona's Gothic Quarter is not just famous for its narrow medieval streets and historic architecture; it is also one of the most popular areas for tourists seeking accommodation through platforms like Airbnb. This popularity has led to significant regulatory responses from the local government to balance the needs of visitors and residents.
