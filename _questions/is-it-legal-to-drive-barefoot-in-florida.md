In Florida, there is no specific law that prohibits driving a vehicle without shoes. It is legal to drive barefoot in the state. However, drivers must always ensure they are in control of their vehicle and driving safely. While driving barefoot is not illegal, it is important to consider whether being barefoot might impair your ability to operate the vehicle's controls effectively, such as the brake or accelerator pedals.

**Trivia:** Despite common myths, driving barefoot or wearing flip-flops is not explicitly illegal in many states, but it may not be advisable due to safety concerns.
