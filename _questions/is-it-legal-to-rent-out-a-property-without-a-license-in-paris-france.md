In Paris, France, the legality of renting out a property without a license primarily depends on the type of rental and the duration. For short-term rentals, particularly of furnished tourist accommodations, the city of Paris requires property owners to register with the town hall and obtain a registration number. This regulation is aimed at controlling the short-term rental market, which includes platforms like Airbnb. Property owners must ensure that their rental activity complies with the local housing regulations, including the maximum allowable days for short-term rentals, which is 120 days per year for a primary residence. For long-term rentals, a license is generally not required, but landlords must adhere to French rental laws which govern lease agreements, tenant rights, and rental conditions.

**Trivia:** Paris has implemented stringent measures to regulate short-term rentals due to concerns that they were contributing to housing shortages and driving up property prices, affecting the availability of long-term rental housing for residents.
