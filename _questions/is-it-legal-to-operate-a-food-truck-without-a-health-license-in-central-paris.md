In central Paris, as in the rest of France, it is illegal to operate a food truck or any food service establishment without obtaining the necessary health licenses. The primary regulation that governs this requirement is the French Public Health Code, which mandates that all food businesses must comply with specific hygiene and safety standards to ensure public health protection. This includes obtaining a health license that verifies the food truck's compliance with food safety regulations, proper waste disposal, and cleanliness standards. Failure to possess such a license can result in significant penalties, including fines and the possibility of being shut down by health inspectors.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict food safety laws, which are part of why it has a global reputation for high-quality cuisine. Interestingly, the city has seen a significant increase in the popularity of food trucks in recent years, offering everything from traditional French fare to international dishes, reflecting Paris's diverse culinary scene.
