In Paris, the legality of renting out your home on Airbnb without a permit depends on several factors, including the duration and frequency of the rental, as well as the type of property. According to Parisian regulations, if you are renting out your primary residence (where you live for at least 8 months of the year), you can do so for up to 120 days per year without a special permit. However, if you wish to rent it out for more than 120 days per year or if the property is not your primary residence, you must register the property with the city and obtain a commercial zoning permit. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most active markets for Airbnb, with thousands of listings available. The city has implemented stricter regulations in recent years to balance the needs of local residents with the booming tourist industry, partly due to concerns about housing shortages and the preservation of community spaces.
