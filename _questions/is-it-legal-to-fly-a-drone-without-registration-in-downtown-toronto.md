In downtown Toronto, as in the rest of Canada, flying a drone without proper registration is generally illegal, especially for drones weighing between 250 grams and 25 kilograms. Transport Canada requires such drones to be registered and the operator to hold a valid drone pilot certificate. The regulations are designed to ensure safety in the airspace and to mitigate risks associated with flying drones in populated areas. Moreover, flying drones in downtown areas can be particularly sensitive due to the proximity to airports and heliports, as well as the presence of many people and high-rise buildings, which pose additional risks and challenges.

**Trivia:** Did you know? The first recorded use of a drone for warfare dates back to 1849, when Austria attacked Venice with unmanned balloons loaded with explosives.
