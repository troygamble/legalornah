In Paris, France, renting out a residential property as a short-term holiday let is subject to specific regulations aimed at controlling the rental market and preserving residential housing. Property owners must register the property with the city authorities to obtain a registration number. This number must be displayed on any rental listings. Furthermore, if the property is the owner's primary residence, it can be rented out for short-term stays for up to 120 days per year. However, if the property is not the owner's primary residence, the owner must obtain a change of use permit, which involves converting the property's status from residential to commercial, a process that can be complex and is subject to approval from city authorities.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on short-term rentals, largely due to concerns about housing shortages and the preservation of the city's historic character. These regulations are part of a broader effort to ensure that the housing market remains accessible to long-term residents amidst the popularity of short-term tourist rentals.
