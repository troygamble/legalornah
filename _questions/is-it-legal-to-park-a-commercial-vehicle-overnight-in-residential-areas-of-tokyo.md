In Tokyo, the legality of parking a commercial vehicle overnight in residential areas depends on various factors including local ordinances, the size and type of the vehicle, and specific regulations that might be enforced by the local ward or municipality. Generally, Tokyo has strict regulations regarding parking to manage its dense population and limited space. Large trucks, trailers, and other heavy commercial vehicles are often restricted from parking in residential areas to reduce noise, congestion, and safety risks. However, smaller commercial vehicles might be allowed if they do not violate any local noise ordinances or block public ways.

**Trivia:** Tokyo is known for its efficient use of space and extensive public transportation system, which significantly reduces the necessity for personal and commercial vehicle use, especially in central areas. This efficiency is one reason why Tokyo's air quality has improved over the decades despite its dense population.
