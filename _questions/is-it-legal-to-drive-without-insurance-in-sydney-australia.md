In Sydney, Australia, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without at least Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance, also known as a Green Slip. This insurance is mandatory for all motor vehicles registered in New South Wales (NSW), the state where Sydney is located. CTP insurance provides coverage for liability in case a driver causes injury to another person in a motor vehicle accident. Driving without this insurance can result in severe penalties, including fines, demerit points on the driver's license, and potentially the suspension of the vehicle's registration.

**Trivia:** Australia's Compulsory Third Party insurance system was first introduced to provide a safety net ensuring that individuals injured in vehicular accidents could obtain financial compensation, even if the at-fault driver was unable to pay for the damages.
