In central Paris, the legality of renting out a room on Airbnb without a specific license depends on several factors including the duration of the rental and the type of property being rented. According to Parisian regulations, individuals are allowed to rent out their primary residence (the home where they live for at least 8 months a year) on short-term rental platforms like Airbnb for up to 120 days per year without a commercial license. However, for rentals that exceed this duration or for properties that are not the owner's primary residence, a commercial license is required. This regulation is enforced to prevent a shortage of long-term rental properties in the city, which can be exacerbated by the conversion of residential units into vacation rentals.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top cities in the world for Airbnb listings, but it has also been at the forefront of implementing strict regulations to control the impact of short-term rentals on local housing markets.
