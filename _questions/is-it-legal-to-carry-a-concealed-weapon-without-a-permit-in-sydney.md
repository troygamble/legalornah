In Sydney, as well as throughout Australia, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without the appropriate permit. Australian laws are very strict regarding the possession and carrying of weapons, particularly firearms. The Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW) and the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) govern the use, possession, purchase, and carrying of firearms and other prohibited weapons in New South Wales. Individuals must obtain specific licenses and permits to possess or carry firearms, and these are typically granted only under stringent conditions, including background checks, safety training courses, and genuine reasons for holding a firearm, such as for sporting or occupational purposes.

**Trivia:** Australia's stringent gun control laws were largely a result of the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania, where 35 people were killed. This tragic event significantly influenced gun legislation in Australia, leading to a massive buyback of firearms and stricter gun control laws.
