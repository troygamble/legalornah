In New York City, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a valid license. New York State, including NYC, operates under strict gun control laws that require individuals to obtain a license to legally possess or carry firearms, including handguns. The process to obtain a license is stringent and includes background checks, fingerprinting, and sometimes even an interview. Specifically, for carrying a concealed handgun, one must obtain a Concealed Carry Weapons (CCW) license, which is notoriously difficult to acquire in NYC due to its stringent requirements and the discretion given to local authorities in issuing these permits.

**Trivia:** New York City has some of the strictest gun laws in the United States. Interestingly, even former President Donald Trump, a New Yorker, once had a concealed carry license in NYC, a rarity among the city's residents.
