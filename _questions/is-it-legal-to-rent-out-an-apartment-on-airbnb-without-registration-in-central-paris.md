In central Paris, it is not legal to rent out an apartment on Airbnb without proper registration. The city of Paris has implemented strict regulations to control the short-term rental market, primarily to address housing shortages and ensure residential spaces are not converted into tourist accommodations without oversight. Homeowners are required to register with the city and obtain a registration number, which must be displayed on any online listings. This registration helps the city monitor and limit the number of days an apartment can be rented out, which is capped at 120 days per year for primary residences.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most active markets for Airbnb, with thousands of listings throughout the city. The stringent regulations were partly a response to concerns that short-term rentals were contributing to increased rent and a shortage of long-term housing for residents.
