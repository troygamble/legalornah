In Shibuya, Tokyo, the legality of street performances, often referred to as 'busking,' depends on specific local regulations and the nature of the performance. Shibuya Ward has guidelines and sometimes requires permits for public performances to ensure that they do not disrupt public order or inconvenience residents and businesses. Performers are generally required to obtain permission from the local ward office or the property owners of private spaces where they wish to perform. This is to regulate noise levels, crowd control, and maintain pedestrian traffic flow, especially in crowded areas like Shibuya Crossing.

**Trivia:** Shibuya is famous for its vibrant street culture including music and fashion. It's also home to the famous Hachiko statue, a popular meeting point and itself a symbol of loyalty and perseverance, often surrounded by various street performers and artists.
