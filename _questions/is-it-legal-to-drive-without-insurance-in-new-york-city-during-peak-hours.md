In New York City, as in the rest of New York State, it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle without having active auto insurance. This law applies regardless of the time of day, including peak hours. New York State requires all drivers to maintain a minimum level of liability insurance, which covers costs associated with damages or injuries to other people or property if the insured driver is at fault in an accident. Driving without insurance is considered a traffic violation and can lead to severe penalties including fines, license suspension, and vehicle impoundment.

**Trivia:** New York was one of the first states in the U.S. to require automobile liability insurance. This mandate was put into place to ensure that all drivers could cover the cost of damages or injuries caused to others in an auto accident.
