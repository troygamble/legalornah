In Paris, France, it is legal to rent out your home on Airbnb, but there are specific regulations that must be followed. Homeowners are allowed to rent out their primary residence (the home where they live most of the year) on platforms like Airbnb for up to 120 days per year. This limitation is designed to prevent permanent conversions of residential properties into full-time vacation rentals, which can affect local housing markets and community dynamics. Additionally, homeowners must register with the city and obtain a registration number that must be displayed on any online listing. Failure to comply with these rules can result in hefty fines.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top tourist destinations in the world, and the availability of short-term rentals through platforms like Airbnb has played a significant role in how tourists experience the city, often opting for more residential and authentic neighborhood settings rather than traditional hotel districts.
