In Houston, Texas, the legality of carrying a concealed weapon without a permit depends on the type of weapon and the circumstances. As of September 1, 2021, Texas law allows eligible individuals to carry handguns without a permit, both openly and concealed. This law, known as 'Constitutional Carry' or 'permitless carry,' applies to residents and visitors who are 21 years or older and who are not legally prohibited from possessing firearms. However, there are restrictions; for example, carrying weapons into certain prohibited locations such as schools, government buildings, or establishments that derive 51% or more of their income from alcohol sales is illegal.

**Trivia:** Texas was one of the last states in the southern United States to adopt permitless carry legislation, a significant change reflecting a broader national trend towards expanding gun rights.
