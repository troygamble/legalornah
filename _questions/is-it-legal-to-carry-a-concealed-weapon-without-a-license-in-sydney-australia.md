In Sydney, Australia, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without the appropriate license. The laws in Australia are very strict regarding the possession and carrying of weapons, including firearms and knives. Individuals must obtain a specific license that justifies their need to carry such weapons, and this typically applies to certain professions or situations deemed necessary for protection or duty. The Firearms Act 1996 and the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 govern the use, possession, and licensing of firearms and other prohibited weapons in New South Wales, which includes Sydney.

**Trivia:** Australia's gun laws are among the strictest in the world, largely due to significant reforms that were implemented following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, where 35 people were killed in a mass shooting. This event was pivotal in shaping the stringent gun control measures seen in the country today.
