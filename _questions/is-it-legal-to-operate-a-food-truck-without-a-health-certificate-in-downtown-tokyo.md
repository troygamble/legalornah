In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a health certificate. The health certificate is a crucial document that confirms the food truck meets the necessary sanitary standards set by local health departments. This certification process involves an inspection of the food truck to ensure it complies with food safety regulations, proper food handling practices, and hygiene standards. The aim is to protect public health by preventing foodborne illnesses.

**Trivia:** Tokyo is known for its vibrant street food culture, which includes a variety of food trucks offering everything from traditional Japanese snacks to international cuisine. The city's strict regulations on food trucks help maintain a high standard of food safety, contributing to the overall enjoyment and trust in street food.
