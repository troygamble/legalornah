Flying a drone in London is subject to specific regulations set by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Drone operators must comply with the Drone and Model Aircraft Code. Key rules include not flying your drone above 400 feet (120 meters), keeping the drone within your line of sight, and not flying it in restricted areas such as near airports or over large crowds. Specifically, in London, there are additional restrictions due to high-security areas and dense population. For example, flying drones near or over government buildings, royal parks, or during significant events often requires special permissions or is entirely prohibited.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first recorded use of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) for warfighting occurred during the Vietnam War? Since then, drone technology has rapidly evolved and expanded into civilian uses, including photography, agriculture, and even delivery services.
