In Toronto, as in all parts of Ontario, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without insurance. Ontario's Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act mandates that every motor vehicle on the road must have at least a minimum level of insurance coverage. This includes third-party liability coverage, which protects against damages that the driver might cause to another person or their property while operating the vehicle. Driving without insurance is considered a serious offense and can result in hefty fines ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. Additionally, if caught, the driver can face a driver's license suspension and the impoundment of their vehicle.

**Trivia:** Did you know that Ontario was one of the first provinces in Canada to require mandatory vehicle insurance? This law was put into effect to ensure that all drivers have financial protection in case of accidents, making roads safer for everyone.
