In Sydney, Australia, it is illegal to use an unregistered vehicle on public roads. According to the Road Transport Act 2013 (NSW), all motor vehicles driven on public roads must be registered with the Roads and Maritime Services (RMS). Registration ensures that vehicles meet minimum safety standards and are covered by compulsory third-party (CTP) insurance. Driving an unregistered vehicle is considered a serious offense and can result in hefty fines, demerit points, and even impoundment of the vehicle. The law is designed to protect road users by ensuring that all vehicles on the road are safe and insured in case of accidents.

**Trivia:** Australia was one of the first countries to implement compulsory third-party insurance, introducing it in the state of South Australia in 1936. This system has since been adopted in various forms across the world.
