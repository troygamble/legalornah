Flying a drone over the Eiffel Tower in Paris without registration is illegal. In France, drone usage is regulated by the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC), which mandates that drones be registered and that operators adhere to specific rules depending on the drone's weight and intended use. The airspace around the Eiffel Tower is particularly sensitive and is classified as a no-fly zone for drones unless specific permission is granted by authorities. This is due to security concerns and the potential for accidents in such a densely populated tourist area.

**Trivia:** The Eiffel Tower was once the world's tallest man-made structure when it was completed in 1889, and it is still one of the most recognized landmarks globally, attracting millions of visitors each year.
