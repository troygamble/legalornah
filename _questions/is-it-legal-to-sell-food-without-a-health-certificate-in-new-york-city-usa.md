In New York City, it is illegal to sell food without a valid health certificate. The New York City Health Code requires all food service establishments, including restaurants, food carts, and food trucks, to obtain a permit or license from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene before they can operate. This involves passing an inspection that ensures the establishment meets health and safety standards. The primary goal of this requirement is to protect public health by ensuring that food is safe, clean, and handled in a sanitary manner. Operating without such a permit not only violates local health regulations but can also result in significant fines and the closure of the business.

**Trivia:** Did you know that New York City has over 20,000 restaurants and food service establishments? The city's health department conducts around 30,000 inspections each year to ensure compliance with health and safety standards.
