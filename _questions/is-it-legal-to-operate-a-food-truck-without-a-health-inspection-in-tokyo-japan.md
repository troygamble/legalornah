In Tokyo, Japan, it is illegal to operate a food truck without undergoing a health inspection. The Food Sanitation Law of Japan mandates that any business involved in the preparation, cooking, storage, and sale of food must adhere to strict health and safety standards to ensure public safety. This includes obtaining a health certificate after a thorough inspection by local health authorities. The inspection assesses various factors including the cleanliness of the food preparation area, the proper handling and storage of ingredients, and the overall hygiene practices of the staff.

**Trivia:** Tokyo is known for its vibrant street food culture, which includes not only traditional Japanese snacks but also a wide variety of international cuisines, making it a popular destination for food enthusiasts from around the world.
