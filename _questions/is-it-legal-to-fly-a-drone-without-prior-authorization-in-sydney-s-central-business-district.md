In Sydney's central business district (CBD), flying a drone without prior authorization is generally prohibited. The regulations governing the use of drones in Australia are enforced by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). These rules are particularly strict in densely populated areas like Sydney's CBD to ensure safety and privacy. Drones are not allowed to be flown over populous areas or near other aircraft without specific permissions. This includes restrictions on flying within 5.5 kilometers of aerodromes or in controlled airspace, which typically covers busy urban centers like Sydney's CBD.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first recorded use of a drone for warfare dates back to 1849, when Austria attacked Venice with unmanned balloons loaded with explosives?
