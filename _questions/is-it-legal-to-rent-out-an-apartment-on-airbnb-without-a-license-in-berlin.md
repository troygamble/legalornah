In Berlin, the legality of renting out an apartment on Airbnb without a license depends on several factors, including the duration and frequency of the rental. Berlin has specific regulations aimed at protecting residential space, which were tightened in 2018. According to these regulations, anyone wishing to rent out their entire apartment to tourists must obtain a permit from the local district office. Partial rental of an apartment, where the host rents out individual rooms while still living in the apartment, is generally allowed for up to 90 days per year without a permit. However, full compliance with local housing laws is required, including the registration of the rental arrangement with local authorities.

**Trivia:** Berlin's strict regulations on short-term rentals were primarily introduced to combat the housing shortage and preserve residential areas for local inhabitants. These measures were part of a broader strategy known as 'Zweckentfremdungsverbot', which literally translates to 'prohibition of misuse'.
