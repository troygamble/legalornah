In Paris, it is illegal to rent out your apartment on a short-term basis without proper registration. The city has specific regulations aimed at controlling the short-term rental market, primarily due to concerns about housing availability and the impact on hotel industry. Property owners who wish to rent out their apartments for short stays (less than 90 days) to tourists must register with the city authorities to obtain a registration number. This number must be clearly displayed in all rental advertisements. The regulation is enforced to ensure that properties are not used exclusively for short-term rentals, which can contribute to a shortage of long-term rental housing and drive up prices.

**Trivia:** Paris's stringent regulations on short-term rentals were partly influenced by the rapid growth of platforms like Airbnb, which led to significant shifts in the city's housing dynamics and concerns about the preservation of local neighborhoods.
