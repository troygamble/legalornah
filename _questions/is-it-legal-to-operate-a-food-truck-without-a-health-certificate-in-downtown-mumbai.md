In Mumbai, as in most cities in India, operating a food truck requires adherence to certain health and safety regulations, which includes obtaining a health certificate. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) mandates that all food businesses, including mobile food trucks, must obtain a health license to ensure that they meet the necessary hygiene and food safety standards. This license is part of the regulatory framework aimed at protecting public health by ensuring that food sold to the public is safe to consume and prepared in sanitary conditions.

**Trivia:** Mumbai is known for its vibrant street food culture, which includes a wide array of local and international cuisines served from food trucks. These mobile eateries have become a popular feature in the city's bustling food scene, blending traditional flavors with modern convenience.
