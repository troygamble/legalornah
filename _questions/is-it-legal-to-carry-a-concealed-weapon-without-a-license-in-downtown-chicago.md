In downtown Chicago, as in the rest of Illinois, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without the appropriate license. Illinois requires individuals who wish to carry a concealed firearm to obtain an Illinois Concealed Carry License (CCL) from the Illinois State Police. This license mandates completing a firearms training course and passing a background check. The law is stringent about carrying firearms without a license, and doing so can lead to significant legal consequences, including fines and imprisonment. The regulations are particularly strict in areas with higher population densities, such as downtown Chicago, to ensure public safety.

**Trivia:** Illinois was the last state in the United States to allow public possession of concealed guns. The state's Concealed Carry Act was passed in 2013 after a federal appeals court mandated Illinois to put in place a law allowing for concealed carry.
