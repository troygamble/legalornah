In downtown Toronto, as in the rest of the city, operating a food truck without a health inspection certificate is illegal. The City of Toronto mandates that all food trucks must obtain a valid health inspection certificate as part of their Mobile Food Vending Permit. This certificate ensures that the food truck meets all health and safety regulations, which are crucial for protecting public health. The health inspection checks for proper food handling, storage, and preparation practices, along with the cleanliness and maintenance of the food truck.

**Trivia:** Did you know? Toronto's food truck scene has expanded rapidly, with gourmet trucks offering a wide range of cuisines from around the world. This diversity reflects Toronto's status as one of the most multicultural cities globally.
