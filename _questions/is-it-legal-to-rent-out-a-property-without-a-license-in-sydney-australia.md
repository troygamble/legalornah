In Sydney, Australia, the legality of renting out a property without a license depends on the type of rental and the specific local regulations. For standard residential rentals, landlords generally do not need a specific 'rental license.' However, compliance with the Residential Tenancies Act 2010 is mandatory, which includes registration of the rental bond and adherence to safety and habitability standards. On the other hand, if the property is being rented out as a short-term holiday rental, such as through platforms like Airbnb, different rules may apply. As of 2021, New South Wales (NSW) introduced specific regulations for short-term rental accommodations, requiring property owners to register their property in a statewide register and adhere to a code of conduct.

**Trivia:** Sydney is known for its vibrant property market and was one of the first cities in Australia to introduce specific legislation addressing the sharing economy's impact on housing, particularly with the rise of short-term rental platforms.
