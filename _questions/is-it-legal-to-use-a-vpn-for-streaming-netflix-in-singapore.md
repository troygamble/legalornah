In Singapore, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) is not illegal. VPNs are commonly used for enhancing security and privacy when accessing the internet. However, the legality of using a VPN for streaming services like Netflix can be complex. While it's not illegal to use a VPN per se, using it to access content that is geo-restricted can violate the terms of service of streaming platforms like Netflix. Netflix's terms of service specifically state that users should only access the service's content within the country where they have established an account and only from territories where Netflix offers its service. The use of VPNs to bypass geographic restrictions is typically against these terms.

**Trivia:** Netflix uses sophisticated technology to detect and block VPNs. Despite this, VPN providers continually adapt, creating a cat-and-mouse game between the streaming service and VPN services.
