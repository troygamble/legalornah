In Sydney, Australia, as well as throughout the state of New South Wales (NSW), it is illegal to drive a vehicle without at least Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance. This type of insurance, also known as 'Green Slip' insurance in NSW, is mandatory and covers the driver for any legal liability for injury or death caused to other road users in the event of an accident. Failure to have CTP insurance can result in significant fines, the suspension of one's driver's license, and the inability to register the vehicle.

**Trivia:** Australia was one of the first countries to introduce compulsory third party personal injury insurance. New South Wales implemented this insurance scheme back in 1942.
