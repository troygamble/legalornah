In Paris, it is illegal to rent out an unregistered holiday home. The city authorities require all rental properties used for short-term holiday rentals to be registered with the local government. This registration process includes obtaining a registration number that must be displayed in all rental advertisements. The purpose of this regulation is to ensure compliance with local housing standards and to monitor the impact of short-term rentals on the housing market. Failure to register can result in significant fines and penalties for the property owners.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on short-term rentals, which have been implemented in part to preserve the character and availability of residential housing in the city's central areas. The city has even deployed a special team to track down unregistered vacation rentals.
