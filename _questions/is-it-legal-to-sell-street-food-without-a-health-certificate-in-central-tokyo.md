In central Tokyo, as in most parts of Japan, it is illegal to sell street food without obtaining the necessary health certificates and permits from local authorities. The Food Sanitation Act of Japan requires all food business operators to adhere to strict hygiene standards to ensure public health safety. This includes acquiring a health certificate that confirms the business maintains sanitary conditions and the staff has undergone proper health and hygiene training. Additionally, local municipalities, including the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, have their own regulations that further govern the operation of street food vendors, emphasizing the need for proper licensing and adherence to local health codes.

**Trivia:** In Tokyo, the annual Sanja Matsuri festival is famous for its vibrant display of street food stalls. These stalls, however, are temporary but must still comply with the same stringent health regulations as permanent street food vendors to operate during the festival.
