In Tokyo, including the Shibuya district, the use of drones for commercial purposes such as photography generally requires obtaining the appropriate permissions and licenses due to strict regulations aimed at ensuring safety and privacy. Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau under the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has established rules that require operators to secure a license if the drone weighs more than 200 grams. Additionally, special permissions are needed for flying drones in densely populated areas or near airports. Commercial operators must also comply with guidelines that include not flying drones over crowds or at night without prior approval.

**Trivia:** Shibuya, known for its bustling streets and the famous Shibuya Crossing, is a hotspot for photography and film-making. The use of drones in such a crowded area is heavily regulated to prevent accidents and ensure the privacy and safety of the public.
