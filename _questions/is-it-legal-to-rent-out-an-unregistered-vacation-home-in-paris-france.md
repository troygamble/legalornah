In Paris, France, it is illegal to rent out an unregistered vacation home. The city requires all vacation rental property owners to register their properties with the local authorities before listing them for short-term rental. This regulation is part of a broader effort to manage the supply of tourist accommodations, preserve residential housing stock, and ensure compliance with local tax laws. Once registered, the property owner receives a registration number that must be displayed in all advertisements and listings for the rental property. Failure to comply with these registration requirements can result in substantial fines and penalties.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stricter regulations partly in response to the rapid growth of platforms like Airbnb, which dramatically increased the number of short-term rentals available, impacting the local housing market and community dynamics.
