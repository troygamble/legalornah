In New York City, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. New York State law requires individuals who wish to carry a concealed firearm to obtain a permit through a strict and detailed application process that involves background checks, fingerprinting, and in some cases, an interview. Specifically, New York Penal Law Section 400 outlines the requirements and restrictions related to the issuance of handgun licenses, including those for concealed carry. New York City has even stricter regulations and a more rigorous process due to its unique security concerns and dense population. The permit process is managed by the New York City Police Department, and failure to comply with these laws can result in severe penalties including fines and imprisonment.

**Trivia:** New York City's gun laws are among the strictest in the United States. Interestingly, even former President Donald Trump, a lifelong New Yorker, once held a concealed carry permit in the city, highlighting the diverse range of individuals who may seek and obtain such permits under city regulations.
