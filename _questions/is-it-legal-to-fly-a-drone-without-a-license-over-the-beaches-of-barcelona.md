In Barcelona, as in the rest of Spain, the legality of flying a drone without a license over beaches depends on several factors including the type of drone, its use, and specific local regulations. According to Spanish aviation authority regulations, drones that weigh less than 250 grams may be flown without a license for recreational purposes in areas that are not heavily populated. However, beaches, especially during peak times, might be considered populated areas, requiring special permissions or adherence to specific rules. Additionally, flying drones in proximity to airports or in protected natural areas is typically restricted, and some beaches may fall within these zones.

**Trivia:** Did you know? In 2017, Barcelona's city council implemented the use of drones to help monitor and manage the cleanliness of its beaches, proving that drones can play a variety of roles in urban management beyond just recreation or photography.
