In Sydney, as in most places in Australia, the legality of operating a business without a local license largely depends on the type of business and the specific activities it engages in. Certain types of businesses, such as those involved in food service, healthcare, and education, require specific licenses and permits to operate legally. These licenses ensure that the businesses meet local health, safety, and professional standards. For other types of businesses, such as certain online ventures or freelance operations, the licensing requirements may be less stringent or not applicable at all. However, it is crucial for all business owners to check with local authorities, such as the City of Sydney Council, to understand the specific licensing requirements applicable to their business operations.

**Trivia:** Sydney, known for its vibrant business environment, is also famous for hosting one of the world's largest natural harbors. This harbor not only boosts the city's tourism but also significantly influences its commercial and business activities, making Sydney a key player in international trade and business.
