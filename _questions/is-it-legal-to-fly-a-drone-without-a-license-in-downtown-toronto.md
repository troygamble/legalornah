In downtown Toronto, the legality of flying a drone without a license largely depends on the type and purpose of the drone operation. According to Transport Canada's regulations, drones that weigh between 250 grams and 25 kilograms and are used for anything other than fun or recreation require the operator to have a drone pilot certificate. Additionally, downtown Toronto, with its high density of buildings and people, falls under controlled airspace. This means that flying a drone in this area typically requires permission from Nav Canada, the country's civil air navigation services provider. Drone operators must also comply with the Canadian Aviation Regulations, which include staying away from emergency operations and advertised events, not flying higher than 122 meters (400 feet), and maintaining a clear line of sight with the drone at all times.

**Trivia:** The first recorded use of a drone for warfare took place in 1849 when Austria attacked Venice with unmanned balloons loaded with explosives.
