In Paris, it is illegal to rent out an apartment on a short-term basis without proper registration. The city has specific regulations aimed at controlling the short-term rental market, primarily to protect the local housing supply and maintain neighborhood stability. Homeowners who wish to rent their properties on platforms like Airbnb must register with the city to obtain a registration number. This number must be displayed in all rental advertisements. The law also restricts the rental of entire apartments to a maximum of 120 days per year, after which the property can only be rented out while the main resident is present.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stringent regulations as a response to the rising concerns that short-term rentals were contributing to housing shortages and driving up rental prices for local residents. This has made Paris one of the most closely regulated cities in the world concerning short-term rentals.
