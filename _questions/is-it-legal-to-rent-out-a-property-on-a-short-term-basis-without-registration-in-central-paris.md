In central Paris, it is illegal to rent out a property on a short-term basis without proper registration. The city of Paris has implemented strict regulations to manage the proliferation of short-term rentals, which are often facilitated through platforms like Airbnb. Property owners are required to register with the city's authorities and obtain a registration number, which must be displayed in all rental advertisements. This measure aims to ensure compliance with local housing laws and to maintain the availability of long-term rental properties for residents. Additionally, there are caps on the number of days a property can be rented out on a short-term basis annually, further emphasizing the need for adherence to these regulations.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict short-term rental laws partly because of its high tourism rates, which can lead to a shortage of affordable housing for locals. The city has even deployed a team of inspectors to track down illegal rentals, highlighting the seriousness with which it approaches this issue.
