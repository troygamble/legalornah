In Maharashtra, as in the rest of India, the legality of flying drones for photography depends on several factors including the type of drone, the purpose of the flight, and the specific location. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) regulates drone operations under the National Drone Policy, which categorizes drones based on their weight and specifies different rules for each category. For instance, nano drones (weighing less than 250 grams) generally have fewer restrictions, while larger drones require more stringent compliance, including registration, pilot licensing, and prior approval for flights, especially in densely populated areas or near airports and military bases.

**Trivia:** Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra, is known for its iconic skyline and beautiful coastal views, making it a popular location for aerial photography using drones. However, due to security concerns, specific areas in Mumbai have strict no-fly zones for drones.
