In Sydney, Australia, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health inspection certificate. The operation of food trucks falls under the Food Act 2003 (NSW) and the Food Standards Code, which mandate that all food businesses, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, must adhere to strict hygiene and food safety standards. Before a food truck can commence operations, it must be inspected by local council health inspectors to ensure compliance with these standards. A health inspection certificate is then issued as proof of this compliance, which must be displayed prominently within the food truck.

**Trivia:** Sydney is known for its vibrant food truck culture, with the city hosting various food truck festivals throughout the year. These festivals not only showcase a diverse array of cuisines but also highlight the city's commitment to maintaining high food safety standards.
