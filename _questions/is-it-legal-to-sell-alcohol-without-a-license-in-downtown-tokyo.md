In Japan, the sale of alcohol without a proper license is illegal, including in downtown Tokyo. The regulation of alcohol sales is governed by the Liquor Tax Law and the Law Concerning Liquor Business Associations. These laws require any business or individual wishing to sell alcohol to obtain a license from the National Tax Agency. The licensing process involves meeting specific criteria that ensure the responsible sale of alcoholic beverages, including the suitability of the location, the character of the applicant, and adherence to public safety standards.

**Trivia:** Tokyo has a vibrant nightlife scene, and it is famous for its small bars in areas like Shinjuku's Golden Gai, where each bar's unique theme and decor contribute to the city's diverse drinking culture. Despite their small size, all these bars are required to have licenses to legally serve alcohol.
