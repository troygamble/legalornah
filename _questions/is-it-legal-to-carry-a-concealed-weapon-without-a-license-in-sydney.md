In Sydney, as in the rest of Australia, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without the appropriate license. Australian laws are very strict regarding the possession and carrying of weapons, particularly firearms. Individuals must have a valid reason for owning a weapon, such as sport shooting or hunting, and must undergo background checks and safety training to be granted a license. Concealed carry of weapons, especially firearms, is generally not permitted even for those with a license, as Australian laws prioritize public safety and heavily regulate the use and storage of firearms.

**Trivia:** Australia implemented strict gun control measures in 1996 following the Port Arthur massacre, where 35 people were killed. The government initiated a massive buyback of firearms and introduced rigorous new gun laws, which significantly reduced gun violence in the country.
