In Cape Town, South Africa, the legality of fishing without a license in coastal areas depends on the specific regulations set by local and national authorities. The Marine Living Resources Act governs recreational fishing and mandates that anyone engaging in fishing activities must possess a valid fishing permit. These permits are required to ensure sustainable fishing practices and to protect marine biodiversity. Different permits may be required for various types of fishing, such as line fishing or collecting marine organisms, and these permits specify what species can be caught, as well as when and where fishing is allowed.

**Trivia:** Cape Town is known for its rich marine life, including the unique spectacle of the annual sardine run, which attracts not only fish but also larger predators and numerous bird species, making it a popular event for both tourists and marine biologists.
