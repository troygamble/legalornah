In Paris, France, it is not straightforwardly legal to rent out your home on Airbnb without a permit. The city has implemented strict regulations governing short-term rentals to address concerns about housing availability and community impact. Homeowners who wish to rent out their residences for short stays are required to register with the city and obtain a registration number. This number must be displayed on any online listings. Additionally, there is a cap on the number of days a property can be rented out short-term, which is limited to 120 days per year for a primary residence. Failing to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most active markets for Airbnb, with thousands of listings available across the city. The strict regulations were partly introduced in response to the city's housing crisis, which was exacerbated by the conversion of long-term rentals into more lucrative short-term tourist accommodations.
