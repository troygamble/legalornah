In Sydney, as in the rest of Australia, whether you need to register a drone depends primarily on its use and weight. According to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), drones weighing more than 250 grams must be registered if they are flown outdoors. This requirement applies to both recreational and commercial use. Additionally, if you are flying a drone for commercial reasons, regardless of its weight, you must register it. CASA provides an online platform for drone registration, and failure to comply with these regulations can lead to penalties.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first recorded use of a drone for warfare took place in 1849 when Austria attacked Venice with unmanned balloons loaded with explosives?
