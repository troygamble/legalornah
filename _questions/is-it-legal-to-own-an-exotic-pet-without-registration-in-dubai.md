In Dubai, the ownership of exotic pets, such as wild cats and other non-domestic animals, is strictly regulated under UAE law. The UAE's Federal Law No. 22 of 2016 on the Possession of Dangerous Animals explicitly prohibits individuals from owning, trading, or breeding dangerous animals, which includes many exotic species, without a specific license. This law was enacted to ensure public safety and animal welfare, requiring potential owners to meet stringent conditions to qualify for a license. These conditions often include providing adequate living conditions for the animals and proving that they can safely secure and care for the pet.

**Trivia:** Dubai is known for its luxurious lifestyle and wealth, which previously made it a hotspot for exotic pet ownership. It was not uncommon to see images of exotic animals like lions or tigers being driven around in fancy cars by their wealthy owners. However, the strict regulations now in place aim to curb this practice for the safety of both the public and the animals.
