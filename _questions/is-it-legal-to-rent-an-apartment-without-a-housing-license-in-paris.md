In Paris, the legality of renting an apartment without a housing license depends on the type of rental being conducted. For short-term rentals, particularly those listed on platforms like Airbnb, a registration number is required from the city authorities. This is part of an effort to regulate the number of days a property can be rented out to tourists, which is limited to 120 days per year for a primary residence. The law aims to prevent housing shortages and preserve residential spaces in the city's central areas. For long-term rentals, a housing license specifically is not typically required, but landlords must comply with various legal standards and registration processes, including ensuring the rental property meets health and safety codes.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stricter regulations on short-term rental properties after noticing a significant impact on local housing markets and neighborhoods, with concerns that the character and availability of residential housing were being eroded due to the profitability of short-term tourist rentals.
