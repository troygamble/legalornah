In Spain, the legality of flying a drone, including over the beaches of Barcelona, depends on several factors such as the type of drone, its weight, the specific location, and the purpose of the flight. Drones weighing less than 250 grams generally do not require a license for recreational use in non-restricted areas. However, for drones heavier than 250 grams, a license is typically required, especially if the drone is used for commercial purposes or flies in controlled airspace or over crowded areas. Barcelona's beaches can be particularly sensitive areas due to the high population density and proximity to the city's airport, which may impose additional restrictions or require special permissions.

**Trivia:** Spain is known for hosting one of Europe's first drone-dedicated air corridors in the province of Teruel, which is used for testing and demonstrating drone technologies.
