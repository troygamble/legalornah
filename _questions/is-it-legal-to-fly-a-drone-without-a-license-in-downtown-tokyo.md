In Tokyo, the legality of flying a drone without a license depends on several factors, including the size of the drone and its intended use. Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau regulates the use of drones through the Civil Aeronautics Act. Drones weighing more than 200 grams require registration, and their operation may require specific permissions or licenses, especially when flown in densely populated areas like downtown Tokyo. The law restricts drone flights in areas near airports and over densely populated areas without prior permission. Additionally, local ordinances in Tokyo may impose stricter rules on drone operations in public spaces, particularly in downtown areas to ensure public safety and privacy.

**Trivia:** Did you know that in Japan, there are designated areas known as 'drone parks' where enthusiasts can fly their drones freely? These parks are established to provide a safe environment for drone flying while preventing disturbances in public and restricted areas.
