In Sydney, as in the rest of Australia, the legality of using a VPN to access streaming services largely depends on the terms of service of the specific streaming platform and the intended use of the VPN. Generally, using a VPN is legal in Australia for purposes such as maintaining privacy and securing internet connections. However, streaming services often have specific clauses in their terms of service that prohibit the use of technologies like VPNs to circumvent geo-restrictions. This is primarily because content licensing agreements are usually region-specific, and accessing content from a region where it is not licensed infringes on these agreements.

**Trivia:** Netflix, one of the most popular streaming services, started actively blocking VPNs and proxies in 2016. This was a significant move that influenced how other streaming platforms manage access via VPNs globally.
