In Mumbai, operating a food truck without a health inspection certificate is illegal. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) mandates that all food business operators, including mobile units like food trucks, must obtain a Food Safety Certificate. This certification ensures that the food truck adheres to the safety guidelines and standards necessary for maintaining public health. The process involves an inspection by health officials to verify that the food truck meets the required hygiene and safety protocols, which includes proper food handling, storage, and preparation practices.

**Trivia:** Mumbai is known for its diverse street food culture, and food trucks have become a trendy addition, offering everything from local favorites to international cuisines, often congregating at popular hubs or during special food festivals.
