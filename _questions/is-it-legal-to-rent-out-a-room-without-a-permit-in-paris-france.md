In Paris, France, the legality of renting out a room without a permit depends on several factors, including the duration of the rental and the type of accommodation. For short-term rentals (less than 120 days per year), homeowners are required to register with the city's authorities and obtain a registration number. This number must be displayed in all advertisements for the rental. If the property is a primary residence, renting it out for short periods does not typically require a specific permit, but adherence to the registration process and the 120-day limit is mandatory. For rentals exceeding 120 days or for properties that are not the owner's primary residence, a change of use permit is required, converting the residential space for commercial use, which involves more stringent regulations and approvals.

**Trivia:** Paris implemented stricter controls on short-term rentals partly due to concerns that platforms like Airbnb were contributing to housing shortages and rising rents in central areas, impacting the availability of long-term rentals for residents.
