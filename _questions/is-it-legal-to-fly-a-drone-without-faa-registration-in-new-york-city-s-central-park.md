In New York City, including Central Park, it is generally illegal to fly drones. The New York City Administrative Code, under Title 10, Section 126, specifically prohibits the takeoff and landing of drones in any public place, including parks, except in designated areas or as permitted for special events. Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) and less than 55 pounds to be registered. FAA regulations also impose restrictions on where drones can be flown, which includes avoiding areas with heavy pedestrian traffic or near airports, which would make most of New York City, including Central Park, a no-fly zone for recreational drone users.

**Trivia:** Did you know? Central Park is featured prominently in many films and TV shows, making it one of the most filmed locations in the world. Despite its popularity in visual media, flying a drone to capture your own aerial footage of the park is off-limits without proper authorization.
