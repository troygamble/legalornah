In Australia, the use of drones, or remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), is regulated by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). According to CASA regulations, drones weighing more than 250 grams must be registered before they can be flown outdoors. Sydney Harbour, being a highly populous and sensitive area, falls under stricter regulations due to its proximity to helipads and its status as a significant landmark. Additionally, flying a drone over Sydney Harbour may also require special approval from CASA to ensure that it does not interfere with commercial air traffic and complies with privacy and safety regulations.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is not only famous for its stunning views but also for hosting one of the world's largest and most spectacular New Year's Eve fireworks displays. Drones capturing this event can provide breathtaking footage, but operators must adhere to strict regulations to ensure safety and compliance.
