In Oregon, the legality of refusing service based on political beliefs can depend on the context and specifics of the situation. Generally, Oregon law prohibits discrimination in public accommodations on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, marital status, age if the individual is of the age of majority, or disability. However, political beliefs or affiliations are not explicitly protected under state anti-discrimination laws. This means that, in most cases, businesses can refuse service based on political beliefs unless the refusal intersects with protections against discrimination for other characteristics that are legally protected.

**Trivia:** In some states in the U.S., political affiliation is a protected class, which means businesses cannot discriminate against customers based on their political beliefs. Oregon, however, does not include political beliefs as a protected class in its anti-discrimination statutes.
