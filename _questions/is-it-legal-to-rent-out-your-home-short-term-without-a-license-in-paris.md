In Paris, renting out your home for short-term stays is regulated, especially due to the impact on local housing and tourism. Homeowners must register with the city hall to obtain a registration number, which must be displayed in all rental advertisements. This registration helps in monitoring and ensuring that the property is not rented out for more than 120 days a year, which is the legal limit for a primary residence. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines. For secondary residences, the regulations are even stricter, requiring a change of use permit, which involves a complex process including compensating for the conversion of residential space into commercial use.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most popular cities for tourists worldwide. The regulation of short-term rentals was partly introduced to preserve the local housing market, which was being significantly impacted by the rise of platforms like Airbnb.
