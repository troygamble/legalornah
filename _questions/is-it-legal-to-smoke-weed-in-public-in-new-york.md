In New York, while the use of marijuana for recreational purposes has been legalized, smoking weed in public places is not allowed. The law specifically prohibits the smoking of cannabis wherever smoking tobacco is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, workplaces, indoor bars and restaurants, public parks, and beaches. The regulations are in place to ensure that the use of cannabis does not affect non-users, especially in public and enclosed spaces where secondhand smoke can be a concern.

**Trivia:** New York City is sometimes referred to as 'The Big Apple'. This nickname was popularized in the 1920s by John J. Fitz Gerald, a sports writer for the New York Morning Telegraph.
