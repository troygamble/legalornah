In Toronto, Canada, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health inspection certificate. The City of Toronto mandates that all food truck operators must adhere to the Toronto Public Health food safety regulations. These regulations are designed to ensure that food served to the public is safe and free from contamination. Before a food truck can begin operations, it must pass a health inspection conducted by a public health inspector. This inspection assesses various aspects of the food truck, including the handling and storage of food, the cleanliness of the vehicle, and the health practices of the staff.

**Trivia:** Food trucks in Toronto have become increasingly popular, evolving from simple hot dog carts to gourmet trucks offering a wide variety of cuisines. The city even hosts annual food truck festivals that attract both locals and tourists.
