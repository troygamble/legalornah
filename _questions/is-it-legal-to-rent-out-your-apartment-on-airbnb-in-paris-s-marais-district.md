In Paris, including the Marais district, it is legal to rent out your apartment on Airbnb, but there are strict regulations that must be followed. Homeowners must register the property with the city hall to obtain a registration number, which must be clearly displayed in all rental listings. Additionally, there is a 120-day annual limit on renting out primary residences, meaning the property must be the owner's main living place for the majority of the year. For secondary residences, a different set of rules applies, generally involving converting the property's status and possibly facing different tax implications.

**Trivia:** The Marais district is not only popular for its historic sites and vibrant nightlife but also holds a significant place in Airbnb's history in Paris, being one of the most sought-after locations for tourists seeking short-term rentals.
