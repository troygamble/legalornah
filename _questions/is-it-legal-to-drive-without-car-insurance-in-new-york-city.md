In New York City, as in the rest of New York State, it is illegal to drive without car insurance. New York State law requires all motor vehicles registered in the state to have insurance. The minimum insurance coverage required includes liability insurance to cover bodily injury to others, personal injury protection to cover medical expenses and lost wages, and uninsured motorist coverage. Driving without insurance can result in severe penalties including fines, vehicle impoundment, suspension of driver's license, and potentially jail time. It is crucial for drivers to maintain at least the minimum required insurance to comply with state laws and to provide financial protection in case of accidents.

**Trivia:** New York was one of the first states in the U.S. to require automobile liability insurance, which became mandatory in 1956.
