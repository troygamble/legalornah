The legality of using a VPN for streaming in Beijing's Chaoyang district is not straightforward and depends on several factors. In China, the government regulates internet use heavily, and the use of VPNs is generally restricted. The Chinese government requires all VPN providers to obtain a government license and approval to operate legally. Using an unauthorized VPN can lead to penalties, including fines. However, some state-approved VPNs are available, which are legal but often come with restrictions and monitoring.

**Trivia:** Despite strict regulations on internet usage, China has one of the highest numbers of internet users globally, with over 900 million people connected online as of 2020.
