In Paris, renting out your home for short-term stays, typically through platforms like Airbnb, depends on several regulations set by the city council. Homeowners can rent out their primary residence for up to 120 days per year without needing a special permit. However, this is limited to the homeowner's main residence, meaning the place where they live for most of the year. For properties that are not the owner's primary residence, a change of use permit is required to legally rent the property for short stays. This regulation is in place to help maintain available housing for long-term residents and prevent an oversupply of short-term tourist rentals, which can drive up housing prices and change neighborhood dynamics.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most popular cities for tourists in the world. This popularity has led to a significant number of properties being listed on short-term rental platforms. In response, the city has implemented strict regulations to balance the needs of tourists and residents, including requiring registration numbers in all advertisements to ensure compliance with the 120-day rule.
