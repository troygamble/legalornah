In Toronto, as in all parts of Ontario, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without insurance. Ontario's Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act mandates that every motor vehicle must be insured under a motor vehicle liability policy. This policy should provide a minimum coverage amount specified by the law, which includes third-party liability, statutory accident benefits, direct compensation property damage, and uninsured automobile coverage. Driving without insurance is considered a serious offense and can result in hefty fines ranging from $5,000 to $50,000, driver's license suspension, and vehicle impoundment.

**Trivia:** Interestingly, despite the strict laws against driving without insurance, Ontario consistently has one of the highest average auto insurance rates in Canada. This is often attributed to the high number of claims and the extensive benefits provided under the province's insurance plans.
