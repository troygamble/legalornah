Flying a drone over Sydney Harbour without registration is not legal under Australian aviation laws. In Australia, the operation of drones is regulated by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), which requires registration of drones weighing more than 250 grams. Sydney Harbour, a highly populated and iconic location, falls under stricter regulations due to its proximity to heliports and its status as a sensitive area. Drone operators must adhere to CASA's rules, which include not only registration but also ensuring that the drone is flown within visual line-of-sight and not above people without their consent, among other safety measures.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is not only famous for its stunning views but also for being a no-fly zone during certain events such as New Year's Eve fireworks, where drone activity is heavily restricted to ensure safety and security.
