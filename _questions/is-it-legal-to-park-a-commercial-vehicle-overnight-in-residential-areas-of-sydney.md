In Sydney, the legality of parking a commercial vehicle overnight in residential areas largely depends on the specific local council regulations and the type of vehicle. Most local councils in Sydney have regulations that restrict the parking of heavy and large commercial vehicles in residential areas to preserve the amenity of the neighborhood and to ensure safety on residential streets. These regulations often include restrictions on the times during which commercial vehicles can be parked and limitations based on the vehicle's size or weight.

**Trivia:** In Sydney, some residential areas are equipped with signage that specifically prohibits the parking of trucks or commercial vehicles overnight, which is a measure intended to prevent streets from becoming de facto commercial parking lots.
