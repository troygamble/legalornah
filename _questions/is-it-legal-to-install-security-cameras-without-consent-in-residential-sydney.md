In Sydney, the legality of installing security cameras in residential areas without consent primarily depends on where the cameras are placed and whose privacy might be infringed upon. Under the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW), it is generally illegal to install a camera in a location that intrudes on someone's expected privacy without their consent. This means that cameras should not record video or audio from areas where individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as inside their homes or in private backyards. However, installing cameras in public or common areas of a residential building, like entrances or lobbies, is often permissible if it is for security purposes and does not infringe on specific privacy rights.

**Trivia:** Did you know? Sydney's Opera House, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is monitored by numerous security cameras. These cameras are part of a sophisticated security system designed to protect both the iconic building and the millions of visitors it attracts each year.
