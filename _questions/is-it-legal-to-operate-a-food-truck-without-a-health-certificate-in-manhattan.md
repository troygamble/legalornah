In Manhattan, as in all of New York City, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health certificate. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene requires all food service establishments, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, to obtain a permit and display a health certificate. This certificate ensures that the food truck meets all sanitary standards and that the staff handling food are trained in proper food safety practices. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in fines, and the food truck may be shut down until all health and safety standards are met.

**Trivia:** New York City has a vibrant food truck culture, with over 5,000 mobile food vendors licensed by the city. These trucks offer a diverse array of cuisines, reflecting the city's multicultural character.
