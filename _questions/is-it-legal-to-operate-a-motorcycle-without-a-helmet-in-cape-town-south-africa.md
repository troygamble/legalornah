In Cape Town, as well as throughout South Africa, it is illegal to operate a motorcycle without wearing a helmet. This requirement is mandated by the National Road Traffic Act, which stipulates that all motorcyclists, including drivers and passengers, must wear helmets that meet specific safety standards. These regulations are enforced to enhance safety on the roads, reducing the risk of head injuries in the event of an accident. The law applies uniformly across all provinces in South Africa, including the Western Cape, where Cape Town is located.

**Trivia:** South Africa is known for its scenic motorcycle routes, such as the famous Garden Route. Wearing a helmet not only complies with local laws but also provides protection against the diverse weather conditions and landscapes that riders may encounter on such trips.
