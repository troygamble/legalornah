In Toronto, Canada, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health license. The City of Toronto mandates that all food trucks must obtain a Mobile Food Vending Permit, which includes a health inspection component conducted by Toronto Public Health. This inspection ensures that the food truck meets all health and safety requirements, which are designed to protect the public from foodborne illnesses and ensure sanitary conditions. Operating a food truck without meeting these requirements can result in fines and the revocation of the food truck's permit.

**Trivia:** Toronto is known for its diverse food truck scene, featuring cuisines from around the world. Every year, the city hosts a variety of food truck festivals, attracting both locals and tourists.
