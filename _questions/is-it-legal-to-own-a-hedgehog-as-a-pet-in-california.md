In California, it is illegal to own a hedgehog as a pet. This prohibition is due to the state's strict exotic animal laws, which are designed to protect public health and safety, as well as native wildlife. California's Department of Fish and Wildlife regulates the possession of exotic animals through stringent laws that prevent the ownership of certain species, including hedgehogs. These laws aim to prevent the introduction of non-native species that could potentially become invasive, pose a threat to native wildlife, or carry diseases that could be transmitted to humans or other animals.

**Trivia:** Despite their cute appearance and popularity in some parts of the world, hedgehogs are considered potential carriers of foot-and-mouth disease, which is one reason why their ownership is restricted in some U.S. states, including California.
