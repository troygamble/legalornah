In Cornwall, as in the rest of the UK, the legality of using a metal detector depends on where you are using it and whether you have obtained the necessary permissions. It is illegal to use a metal detector on private land without the explicit permission of the landowner. Additionally, using a metal detector on protected archaeological sites, such as those designated as Scheduled Monuments, is strictly prohibited without a license from the relevant authority. Beaches may have different rules, and local councils or governing bodies might require a permit or have specific regulations regarding metal detecting on their land.

**Trivia:** Cornwall is renowned for its historical sites and shipwrecks, making it a popular location for metal detecting enthusiasts. The region's rich history, dating back to the Bronze Age, contributes to the high likelihood of discovering ancient artifacts.
