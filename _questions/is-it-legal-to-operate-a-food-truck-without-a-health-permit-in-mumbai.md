In Mumbai, as in most cities in India, operating a food truck requires adherence to certain regulatory requirements, including obtaining a health permit. This permit is crucial as it ensures that the food truck meets the necessary health and safety standards to protect public health. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is the primary body responsible for issuing health permits. These permits assess various aspects of the food truck, including hygiene, food handling practices, and the physical condition of the truck itself, ensuring it is suitable for food preparation and service.

**Trivia:** Mumbai's street food culture is renowned worldwide, and food trucks add a modern twist to this tradition, offering everything from local Maharashtrian snacks to international cuisines, often becoming local attractions in their own right.
