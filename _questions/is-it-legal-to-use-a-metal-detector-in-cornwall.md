The legality of using a metal detector in Cornwall is subject to specific regulations and permissions. Generally, metal detecting is allowed in the UK, but it requires the landowner's permission to legally search on private land. This includes agricultural fields, gardens, and other privately owned properties. Furthermore, metal detecting is strictly regulated on sites of historical importance, which are often protected under national heritage laws. In Cornwall, which is rich in archaeological sites, many areas are designated as Scheduled Monuments where metal detecting is prohibited without a license from the government. Additionally, beaches and public lands may have specific local rules set by the local council or other governing bodies, and these rules can vary widely.

**Trivia:** Cornwall is known for its historical shipwrecks off the coast. Metal detecting enthusiasts often find this area particularly interesting due to the potential of discovering relics washed ashore from these ancient maritime accidents.
