In Tokyo, the legality of renting out an apartment on Airbnb without registration depends on several local regulations and the national Minpaku Law. The Minpaku Law, enacted in June 2018, allows homeowners in Japan to rent out their properties as short-term lodging, but only after registering with the local government. This law was introduced to regulate the booming market of short-term rentals and address concerns such as safety and nuisance. Under this law, a homeowner must obtain a license, and the property can only be rented out for a maximum of 180 days per year. Additionally, some local governments, including Tokyo, may impose stricter rules, such as requiring the presence of a property manager and adherence to local zoning laws.

**Trivia:** Tokyo's strict regulations on Airbnb and other similar platforms were partly influenced by the city's preparation for the 2020 Olympics, aimed at managing the influx of tourists and maintaining hotel industry standards.
