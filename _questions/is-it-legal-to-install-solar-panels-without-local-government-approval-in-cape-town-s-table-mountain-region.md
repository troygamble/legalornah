In Cape Town, particularly in the Table Mountain region, the installation of solar panels generally requires approval from local government authorities due to the area's environmental sensitivity and heritage status. The City of Cape Town has specific regulations and zoning laws that must be adhered to, which often include obtaining a planning permission for alterations to any building or property. This is particularly important in environmentally sensitive areas, where any construction or alteration could potentially impact the natural and cultural heritage. Additionally, the national regulations under the South African National Standards (SANS) for electrical installations also apply, which require that any electrical installation, including solar panels, comply with safety and technical standards.

**Trivia:** Table Mountain, a prominent landmark overlooking the city of Cape Town, is part of the Table Mountain National Park, which is a World Heritage Site. This status adds an extra layer of protection and scrutiny for any construction or modification in the area, including the installation of solar panels.
