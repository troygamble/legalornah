In Miami, as well as throughout the United States, any vessel used for commercial purposes must be registered with the appropriate state or federal authorities. This registration is crucial as it ensures the vessel meets specific safety and operational standards, which are rigorously enforced to protect passengers, crew, and the marine environment. Additionally, commercial vessels often require further certifications and inspections to verify their suitability for carrying passengers, which is especially important for tour boats that frequently operate around populous areas like Miami.

**Trivia:** Did you know that Miami is known as the 'Cruise Capital of the World'? The PortMiami is famous for accommodating some of the world's largest cruise ships and handling more passengers than any other port in the world.
