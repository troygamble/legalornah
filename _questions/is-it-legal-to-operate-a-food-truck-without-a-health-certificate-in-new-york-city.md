In New York City, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health certificate. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene requires all food service establishments, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, to obtain a permit and a health certificate to ensure compliance with local health codes and regulations. These regulations are designed to ensure that food is safe for consumption and that the facilities meet specific hygiene standards. Without these certifications, a food truck operator is subject to fines and may be shut down by health inspectors.

**Trivia:** Did you know that New York City has over 5,000 licensed food carts and trucks? This includes not only trucks but also smaller food carts selling a variety of treats from hot dogs to halal food, making the city's street food scene one of the most diverse in the world.
