In New York City, including Central Park, it is illegal to fly a drone without a license. The New York City Administrative Code, specifically under Section 10-126, prohibits the takeoff and landing of drones within city limits unless specifically authorized by the city's police commissioner. This regulation is part of a broader city effort to ensure safety and privacy for its residents and visitors. Additionally, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates airspace and requires operators to have a Remote Pilot Certificate (Part 107) for commercial drone operations, which involves passing an aeronautical knowledge test.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first recorded use of a drone for filming occurred in 2014 during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia? Drones captured aerial footage of ski and snowboarding events, providing spectacular views that were previously difficult to achieve.
