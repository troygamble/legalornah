In Cape Town, South Africa, it is illegal to rent out an unregistered holiday home. The City of Cape Town has specific regulations that require all holiday accommodation, including short-term rentals such as Airbnb, to be registered with the city's tourism department. This registration helps ensure compliance with safety standards, zoning laws, and tax regulations. Property owners must obtain the necessary zoning rights and adhere to specific guidelines that govern tourist accommodation, which includes applying for planning permission if the property is not zoned correctly for holiday accommodation.

**Trivia:** Cape Town, known for its stunning landscapes and tourist attractions, has seen a boom in the holiday rental market, largely due to platforms like Airbnb. This has led to increased regulations to manage the impact on local housing markets and community life.
