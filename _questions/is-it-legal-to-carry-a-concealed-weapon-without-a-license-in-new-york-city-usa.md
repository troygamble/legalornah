In New York City, carrying a concealed weapon without a license is illegal. New York State has strict gun control laws, and New York City has even more stringent regulations. Under the New York Penal Law, it is a criminal offense to possess a firearm without an appropriate license, and this includes both open and concealed carry. The process to obtain a license in NYC is rigorous, requiring an application, background check, and often a demonstration of necessity for a firearm.

**Trivia:** New York City's gun laws are some of the strictest in the United States. Interestingly, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) issues the gun licenses, and the process is known for being particularly thorough, often taking several months to complete.
