In Sydney, including Bondi Beach, the legality of flying a drone without registration depends on the weight of the drone and its intended use. According to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) in Australia, drones that weigh 250 grams or more must be registered before they can be flown outdoors. This registration process involves providing details about the drone and the operator, as well as paying a fee. For drones under 250 grams used recreationally, no registration is required unless they are flown for commercial purposes. Additionally, drone operators must comply with safety rules, such as keeping the drone within visual line-of-sight, not flying over populous areas like beaches without proper authorization, and maintaining a certain distance from people and other aircraft.

**Trivia:** Bondi Beach is not only famous for its scenic views but also for being a hotspot for drone photographers, especially during events like the annual 'Sculpture by the Sea' exhibition, where unique artworks are displayed along the coastline.
