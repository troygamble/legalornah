In Sydney, Australia, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) is generally legal. VPNs are widely used for various legitimate purposes, such as enhancing online privacy and security. However, the legality of using a VPN for streaming specifically hinges on what content is being accessed and how it is being accessed. If a VPN is used to stream content legally, such as accessing one's paid streaming service account while abroad, this is typically legal. Conversely, using a VPN to circumvent geo-restrictions to access content from a streaming service that one does not have the legal rights to view, or to access pirated content, can be considered illegal.

**Trivia:** Australia is known for having some of the strictest copyright laws globally, which include significant measures against piracy. It is also noteworthy that Australia was one of the first countries to implement a nationwide metadata retention scheme, which requires telecom companies to store their customers' Internet usage data for two years.
