The legality of using a VPN to access streaming services in Berlin, Germany, primarily depends on the purpose and the consequences of using the VPN. German law does not explicitly prohibit the use of VPNs; they are generally legal for privacy and security purposes. However, using a VPN to circumvent geo-restrictions imposed by streaming services may violate the terms of service of those platforms. Although violating a service's terms is not inherently illegal, it can lead to the termination of your service account and potential loss of access to the platform.

**Trivia:** Germany is known for its strict privacy laws and was one of the first countries to adopt data protection laws, with the first one enacted in the state of Hesse in 1970.
