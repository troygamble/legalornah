In Manhattan, New York, it is illegal to operate a food truck without the appropriate permits. The city requires food truck operators to obtain several permits and licenses, including a Mobile Food Vending License from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. This license ensures that the food truck meets health and safety standards, which are crucial in preventing foodborne illnesses. Additionally, operators must secure a Mobile Food Vending Unit Permit for each vehicle, which allows them to park in designated areas legally designated for street vending.

**Trivia:** New York City has a cap on the number of full-term permits available for mobile food vendors, which has led to a competitive and expensive black market for these permits. Some permits can fetch prices as high as tens of thousands of dollars.
