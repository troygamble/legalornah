In Sydney, as in the rest of Australia, the legality of flying a drone without a license depends on several factors including the weight of the drone and the purpose of its use. Drones weighing under 2 kilograms used for recreational purposes do not generally require a license, but must adhere to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's (CASA) standard operating conditions. These conditions include not flying over populous areas, maintaining a certain distance from people, and not operating near emergency operations. For commercial purposes, or if the drone weighs more than 2 kilograms, a license and/or additional certifications from CASA are required. Sydney's Harbour area, being densely populated and a location with significant helicopter and seaplane traffic, imposes stricter regulations and often requires special permissions regardless of the drone's weight or the pilot's licensing status.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is not only a hotspot for tourists but also a critical area for drone researchers. The University of Sydney often conducts advanced drone research, including traffic management systems for drones, which could pave the way for safer and more efficient drone operations in urban environments.
