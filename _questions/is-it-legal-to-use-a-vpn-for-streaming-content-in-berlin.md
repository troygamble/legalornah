Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to stream content in Berlin is not illegal in itself. VPNs are legal in Germany and are commonly used for various purposes, including enhancing online privacy and security. However, the legality of using a VPN for streaming hinges on what you are accessing and how you are using it. For instance, using a VPN to access geo-restricted content that violates copyright laws or terms of service of the streaming platform can lead to legal issues. Many content providers, such as Netflix, have terms of service that restrict the use of technologies like VPNs to bypass geo-restrictions, and violating these terms can result in the termination of the service.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first commercial VPN, called 'PPTP' (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol), was developed by a Microsoft employee in the mid-1990s? This technology was initially designed to secure remote employee access to Microsoft's own corporate network.
