In Tokyo, the legality of renting out a private property as a vacation home largely depends on compliance with the Minpaku Law, which was implemented in Japan in 2018. This law regulates the rental of private homes to tourists, requiring homeowners to register with the local government and adhere to specific rules and regulations. For instance, rentals are limited to 180 days per year, and owners must ensure that their properties meet certain safety and health standards. Additionally, some local governments may impose further restrictions or requirements, such as obtaining permission from neighbors or local community associations.

**Trivia:** The Minpaku Law was introduced partly in response to the housing shortage in Tokyo, exacerbated by the increasing popularity of short-term rentals through platforms like Airbnb. This law aims to balance the needs of tourists and local residents, preserving residential spaces while also accommodating the booming tourism industry.
