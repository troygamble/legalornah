In Sydney, Australia, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) is generally legal. VPNs are commonly used for enhancing online privacy and security by encrypting a user's internet traffic and masking their IP address. However, the legality of using a VPN for streaming movies hinges on the content being accessed and the manner in which it is accessed. If a VPN is used to stream content that is legally available, such as accessing one's own paid subscriptions while traveling, there is typically no legal infringement. Conversely, using a VPN to circumvent geo-restrictions to access content from services to which one does not have legal rights, or to pirate movies, can be considered illegal. This is because it may violate copyright laws and the terms of service of the streaming platforms.

**Trivia:** Australia is known for having some of the strictest copyright enforcement policies in the world, which includes monitoring and penalizing illegal downloading and streaming of copyrighted content.
