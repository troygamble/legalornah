Flying drones for recreational use is legal in Maharashtra, but it is subject to strict regulations set forth by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Recreational drone operators must adhere to the guidelines which include registering the drone with the Digital Sky Platform, obtaining an Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit (UAOP) if the drone weighs more than 250 grams, and ensuring that the drone is NPNT (No Permission No Takeoff) compliant. Additionally, drone flights are restricted in areas near airports, military bases, and other sensitive locations, and they must generally be operated during daylight and within the visual line of sight.

**Trivia:** Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra, hosted Indiaâ€™s first-ever Drone Festival in May 2022, highlighting the growing interest and advancements in drone technology within the region.
