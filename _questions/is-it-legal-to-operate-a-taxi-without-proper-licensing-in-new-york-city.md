In New York City, it is illegal to operate a taxi without the proper licensing. The city has stringent regulations governing the operation of taxis, which are enforced by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The TLC requires all taxi drivers to hold a valid Taxi and Limousine License (TLC License), which involves passing a background check, a drug test, and completing a driver education course. Additionally, taxis must be affiliated with a TLC-authorized dispatch base, and the vehicles themselves must be inspected and approved by the TLC to ensure they meet specific safety and operational standards.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the distinctive yellow color of New York City taxis dates back to the 1960s? It was chosen because John Hertz, the founder of the Yellow Cab Company, read a study suggesting that yellow is the easiest color for the eye to spot!
