In Japan, the use of drones in urban areas, especially in densely populated cities like Tokyo, is strictly regulated under the Unmanned Aircraft Act. Specifically, flying drones in areas designated as densely inhabited districts (DID) without prior permission is prohibited. Downtown Tokyo, being a highly populated area, falls under this category. Additionally, all drones weighing more than 200 grams must be registered with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. This registration process involves providing details about the drone and the operator, and ensuring that the drone meets safety standards set by the authorities.

**Trivia:** Japan was one of the first countries to establish a significant body of regulations concerning drones, largely in response to an incident in 2015 when a drone carrying radioactive material landed on the roof of the Japanese Prime Minister's office.
