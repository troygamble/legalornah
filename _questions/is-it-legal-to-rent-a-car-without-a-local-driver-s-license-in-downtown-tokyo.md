In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, it is generally required for a driver to hold a valid driver's license issued by the Japanese government or an International Driving Permit (IDP) recognized by Japan in order to legally rent and drive a car. Foreigners who do not possess a Japanese driver's license must have an IDP that is based on the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, which Japan recognizes. Additionally, the IDP must be accompanied by a valid license from the driver's home country. It is important for visitors to ensure their IDP is correctly formatted and valid for use in Japan, as not all types of international licenses are accepted.

**Trivia:** In Japan, traffic moves on the left side of the road, which is the opposite of many other countries, including the United States and most of Europe. This tradition dates back to the Edo period (1603-1868) when samurai preferred to walk on the left to avoid clashing their katana (swords) with passers-by.
