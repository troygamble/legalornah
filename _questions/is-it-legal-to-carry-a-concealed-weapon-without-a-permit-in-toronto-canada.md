In Toronto, as in the rest of Canada, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. Canadian law strictly regulates the ownership, storage, and transportation of firearms and other weapons. Carrying a concealed firearm requires a specific type of license known as a 'Carry-Concealed Weapons Permit,' which is extremely difficult to obtain and is usually reserved for individuals who can prove that carrying a weapon is a necessity for their personal safety due to their profession or a proven threat. This permit is rarely issued to the general public.

**Trivia:** Canada's firearm law classifications include 'Non-restricted,' 'Restricted,' and 'Prohibited.' Concealed carry permits are almost exclusively associated with 'Restricted' or 'Prohibited' firearms, highlighting the strict control over concealed weapons in the country.
