In Paris, France, renting out a home on platforms like Airbnb is subject to specific regulations, primarily aimed at controlling the short-term rental market to protect residential housing availability. Homeowners are allowed to rent out their primary residence (the place where they live for at least 8 months per year) on a short-term basis for up to 120 days per year without a commercial license. However, if the property is not the owner's primary residence, or if it is rented out for more than 120 days per year, a commercial license is required. This involves converting the property's status from residential to commercial, which is a process regulated by the city authorities and often includes obtaining approval from the local council.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most active markets for Airbnb, with thousands of listings available across the city. The city has implemented a registration system where every rental listing must display a registration number to help enforce the 120-day annual limit, showcasing the city's proactive approach to integrating modern sharing economy platforms within its urban policies.
