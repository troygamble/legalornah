In New York City, operating a food truck without a health permit is illegal. The city requires all food service establishments, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, to obtain a health permit from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). This permit ensures that the food truck meets specific health and safety standards aimed at preventing foodborne illnesses. The process of obtaining a permit involves an inspection of the food truck to ensure compliance with health codes, proper food handling practices, and sanitation standards.

**Trivia:** New York City is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering a range of cuisines from around the world. One of the first food trucks in NYC was the iconic 'Taco Truck,' which helped to popularize street food across the city.
