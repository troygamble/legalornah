In Sydney, the legality of using a VPN to stream copyrighted content largely depends on the source of the content and how it is being accessed. While using a VPN itself is not illegal in Australia, its use becomes contentious when employed to access geo-restricted content or services that explicitly prohibit such access in their terms of service. The Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) governs copyright protection in Australia and prohibits the unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and public performance of copyrighted materials. Therefore, if a VPN is used to bypass geographical restrictions to access copyrighted content without proper authorization, this could potentially violate copyright laws.

**Trivia:** Australia passed the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill in 2015, which allows rights holders to apply for court orders to block access to foreign websites that facilitate copyright infringement. This legislation highlights the country's stringent measures against copyright violations.
