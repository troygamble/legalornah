Flying a drone in Bavaria, like in the rest of Germany, is subject to specific regulations that vary depending on the drone's weight, purpose, and the area over which it is flown. Drones weighing less than 5 kilograms can generally be flown without a special permit, but they must adhere to certain rules. For instance, drones must not be flown within 100 meters of sensitive areas such as government buildings, hospitals, or disaster zones. Additionally, drone operators are required to maintain visual contact with their drones at all times and are prohibited from flying them above 100 meters without special permission.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the Bavarian town of Herzogenaurach is known as the birthplace of both Adidas and Puma? The rivalry between the two brands originated from a feud between the two founding brothers, Adolf and Rudolf Dassler.
