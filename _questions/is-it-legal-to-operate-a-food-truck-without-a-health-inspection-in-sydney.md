In Sydney, as well as throughout Australia, operating a food truck without undergoing a health inspection is illegal. Food truck operators must comply with the Food Act 2003 (NSW) and the Food Standards Code, which mandate that any business involved in the handling or sale of food must ensure that their operations do not pose a risk to public health. A health inspection certifies that the food truck meets the necessary hygiene and food safety standards. Failure to obtain this certification before commencing operations can result in significant fines, business closure, or other legal penalties.

**Trivia:** Food trucks originated in the United States in the 1860s with the 'Chuck Wagon' which served food to cattlemen and wagon trains. Today, the food truck trend has exploded globally, with Sydney hosting diverse and vibrant food truck festivals that showcase culinary delights from around the world.
