In Tokyo, the legality of renting out a home as a vacation rental is governed by the Japanese 'Minpaku' law, which regulates private lodging services. This law, which came into effect in June 2018, allows homeowners to rent out their properties to tourists for short stays. However, there are specific conditions that must be met. Homeowners must register with the local government and are limited to renting out their properties for a maximum of 180 days per year. Additionally, certain local governments may impose stricter regulations, such as requiring a licensed administrator to be available, or restricting the areas where vacation rentals can operate, particularly in residential zones.

**Trivia:** Tokyo's strict regulations on vacation rentals were largely influenced by concerns from local residents about noise and safety, as well as the desire to maintain hotel industry standards. This led to the implementation of the Minpaku law, which aims to balance the economic benefits of tourism with the lifestyle and rights of local residents.
