In New York City, it is generally not legal to sell homemade food without obtaining the necessary health certifications and permits. The New York City Health Code requires that anyone involved in the preparation and sale of food to the public must have a permit from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). This includes passing an inspection and maintaining certain standards of cleanliness and safety. However, there are exceptions under the New York State's 'cottage food laws' which allow individuals to make and sell certain types of 'non-potentially hazardous' homemade foods, such as baked goods, jams, and jellies, directly to consumers without a health certificate, but these sales are often limited to specific venues and conditions.

**Trivia:** Did you know that New York City was one of the first cities in the United States to implement a public health department in the 19th century? This was largely in response to the cholera outbreaks that affected many urban areas during that time.
