The legality of shooting fireworks in residential areas in Florida depends on several factors including the type of fireworks and the specific local laws. Florida state law allows the use of certain fireworks on designated holidays such as the Fourth of July, New Year's Eve, and New Year's Day. However, outside these specific dates, only fireworks classified for 'agricultural purposes'—such as scaring birds away from fish hatcheries—are generally allowed without special permits.

**Trivia:** In Florida, despite the restrictive laws, the sale of fireworks that are not legal for general use without specific permits is common, often leading to confusion about what is legally permissible.
