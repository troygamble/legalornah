The legality of flying a drone without FAA registration in San Francisco, California, depends on the weight of the drone. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), any drone weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) and less than 55 pounds (approx. 25 kilograms) must be registered with the FAA before it is flown outdoors. This registration is necessary to ensure that drone operators are accountable and that drones are used in a manner that is safe and respects privacy and property laws. For drones weighing 0.55 pounds or less, FAA registration is not required unless they are used for purposes that require special authorization.

**Trivia:** San Francisco is known for its strict regulations on drone usage, especially near landmarks and densely populated areas. For example, flying drones is prohibited in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which includes parts of the San Francisco Bay Area.
