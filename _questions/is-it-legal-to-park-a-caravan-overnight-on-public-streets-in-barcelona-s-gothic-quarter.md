In Barcelona, specifically within the Gothic Quarter and other central areas, parking a caravan overnight on public streets is generally prohibited. The city has strict regulations regarding the use of public spaces, and parking large vehicles like caravans can obstruct traffic flow and pedestrian access. Local ordinances are designed to preserve the aesthetic and historical integrity of areas like the Gothic Quarter, which is known for its narrow streets and bustling tourist activity. Additionally, the local government has implemented various measures to reduce vehicular congestion and promote the use of public transport, further restricting the possibilities for caravan parking in central locations.

**Trivia:** The Gothic Quarter of Barcelona is one of the oldest parts of the city, some buildings date back to medieval times. This area is not only a hub for tourists but also a protected heritage site, which influences many of the local regulations, including those related to traffic and parking.
