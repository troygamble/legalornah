In London, as well as throughout the United Kingdom, it is illegal to conduct online gambling without the appropriate licenses. The Gambling Act of 2005 sets out the framework for the regulation of gambling activities across the UK, including online gambling. This Act mandates that any business or individual wishing to offer gambling services, including online casinos, sports betting, and other gambling platforms, must obtain a license from the UK Gambling Commission. The Commission is responsible for regulating all forms of gambling and ensuring that operators comply with legal requirements, including player protection and fair play.

**Trivia:** The UK Gambling Commission was established under the Gambling Act of 2005 and is known for its strict regulations, which are often considered a gold standard for online gambling regulation worldwide.
