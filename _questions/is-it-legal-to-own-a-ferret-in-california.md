In California, it is illegal to own a ferret as a pet. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulates which animals can be kept as pets, and ferrets are not on the list of permissible species. This prohibition is based on concerns about potential negative impacts on local wildlife and ecosystems should ferrets escape and establish wild populations. Ferrets are known to be potential carriers of diseases such as rabies, and their predatory nature poses a threat to native birds and small mammals.

**Trivia:** Despite their illegality in California, ferrets are legal and popular pets in many other parts of the United States. In fact, they are the third most popular uncaged pet in the United States, following dogs and cats.
