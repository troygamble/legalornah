In Tokyo, Japan, the legality of street performances, often referred to as 'busking,' depends on various factors including the specific location, time, and the type of performance. Tokyo has regulations that govern public performances to manage noise levels and ensure public safety and convenience. Certain areas in downtown Tokyo, particularly popular tourist spots and busy districts, may require performers to obtain a permit from local authorities. These permits are often issued after evaluating the impact of the performance on the local community and traffic.

**Trivia:** In Japan, street performers are sometimes called 'Daidogei'. The city of Tokyo hosts an annual Daidogei World Cup in Shizuoka, which is a festival where street performers from around the world gather to showcase their talents.
