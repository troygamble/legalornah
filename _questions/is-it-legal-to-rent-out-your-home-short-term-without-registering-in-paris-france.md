In Paris, France, it is illegal to rent out your home on a short-term basis without proper registration. The city has implemented strict regulations to control the short-term rental market, primarily to protect the local housing supply. Homeowners must register with the city to obtain a registration number, which must be displayed on all rental listings. This measure is aimed at ensuring that properties are not rented out for more than 120 days per year, which is the legal limit for a primary residence being rented out short-term. Failure to comply with these regulations can lead to heavy fines.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stringent short-term rental laws in response to the rising concerns that platforms like Airbnb were affecting the availability and affordability of housing for local residents.
