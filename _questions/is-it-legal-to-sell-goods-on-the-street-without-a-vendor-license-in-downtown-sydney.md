In downtown Sydney, as in many other cities, the legality of selling goods on the street without a vendor license depends on specific local regulations. Generally, the City of Sydney requires street vendors to obtain a license or permit to sell goods in public spaces. This is to ensure that all street trading activities are regulated for safety, accessibility, and community amenity. The requirements and restrictions can vary based on the type of goods being sold and the specific location within the city. For instance, food vendors might face different regulations compared to those selling clothing or crafts.

**Trivia:** Street vending has a long history in Sydney, dating back to the early colonial days when hawkers sold goods from carts. Today, Sydney's vibrant street markets and food trucks continue this tradition, contributing to the city's dynamic urban culture.
