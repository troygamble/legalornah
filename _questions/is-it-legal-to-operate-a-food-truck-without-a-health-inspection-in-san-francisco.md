In San Francisco, it is illegal to operate a food truck without undergoing a health inspection. The city requires all mobile food facilities, including food trucks, to obtain a permit from the Department of Public Health before they can commence operations. This process includes a thorough health inspection to ensure that the food truck meets all sanitary and safety standards set by local health codes. The inspection covers various aspects such as food handling, storage, preparation areas, and employee hygiene to protect public health and prevent foodborne illnesses.

**Trivia:** San Francisco is known for its vibrant food truck scene, with events like 'Off the Grid' gathering multiple food trucks in one location, offering a diverse range of cuisines from around the world.
