In France, flying a drone over Paris, especially near landmarks, is generally prohibited without specific authorization. The French regulations on drone flights are stringent, particularly in densely populated areas and around sensitive sites such as tourist landmarks, government buildings, and military zones. Paris, being the capital with numerous historical and strategic sites, falls under these strict regulations. Drone operators must adhere to the rules set by the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC), which include not flying drones in restricted zones, maintaining visual line of sight with the drone, and adhering to specific altitude limits. To legally fly a drone over Paris landmarks, one would typically need to obtain a special permit or authorization, which might require demonstrating particular reasons for the flight and ensuring all safety measures are in place.

**Trivia:** Did you know that Paris has specific 'No Drone Zones' that are heavily enforced to protect privacy, security, and safety? This includes areas around many famous landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre, making unauthorized drone flights in these areas not just illegal but also subject to significant fines and penalties.
