In Sydney, Australia, the legality of renting out a home without a specific license generally depends on the type of rental and the duration. For standard residential rentals, landlords are required to comply with the Residential Tenancies Act 2010 (NSW), which regulates the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants but does not typically require a special license. However, if the property is being rented out as a short-term holiday rental, regulations can be different. For instance, New South Wales introduced a code of conduct and a registration requirement for short-term rental accommodations, which requires owners to register their property with the government. This registration serves as a kind of licensing system specific to short-term rentals.

**Trivia:** Sydney is known for its vibrant real estate market and has one of the highest numbers of Airbnb listings per capita in the world. This popularity of short-term rentals has led to specific regulatory responses to manage the impact on local communities and housing availability.
