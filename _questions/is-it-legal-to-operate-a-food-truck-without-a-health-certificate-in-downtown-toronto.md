In downtown Toronto, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a health certificate. The City of Toronto mandates that all food service establishments, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, must possess a valid Municipal Licensing and Standards (MLS) permit, which can only be obtained after securing a health certificate from Toronto Public Health. This certificate ensures that the food truck meets health and safety standards, which are crucial for protecting public health. The process includes inspections that check for proper food handling, storage, and preparation practices, as well as the overall cleanliness and suitability of the vehicle used to serve food.

**Trivia:** Toronto is known for its diverse food scene, including a vibrant array of food trucks that serve everything from traditional Canadian dishes to international cuisine. The city hosts several food truck festivals throughout the year, drawing both locals and tourists.
