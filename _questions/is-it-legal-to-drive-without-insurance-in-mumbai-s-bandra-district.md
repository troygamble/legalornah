In Mumbai, including Bandra district, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without insurance. According to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which applies across India, every vehicle operating on public roads must have at least a third-party liability insurance policy. This type of insurance covers any damage or injury caused by the insured vehicle to another person or property. The purpose of this law is to ensure that in the event of an accident, there are financial means available to cover the damages incurred by victims who are not at fault.

**Trivia:** India was one of the first countries in the world to mandate third-party vehicle insurance. This law was put into place shortly after the Motor Vehicles Act was passed in 1988, emphasizing the country's early recognition of the importance of financial protection against road accidents.
