In Sydney, as in all of Australia, it is required by law to register drones used for commercial purposes. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) oversees drone regulations in Australia and mandates that any drone weighing over 250 grams must be registered if it is used for commercial gain. This includes activities such as aerial photography, inspections, and any other services for which the operator receives payment. Registration involves providing details about the drone and the operator, and it helps in ensuring accountability and safety in airspace usage.

**Trivia:** Australia was one of the first countries to regulate the use of drones in the civilian airspace. This early adoption of regulations reflects Australia's proactive approach to managing emerging technologies and maintaining safety standards.
