In Paris, the legality of renting out a home on Airbnb without a license depends on several factors, including the duration of the rental and the type of property. According to Parisian regulations, individuals are allowed to rent out their primary residence (the home where they live for at least 8 months a year) on platforms like Airbnb for up to 120 days per year without a special license. However, if the property is not the owner's primary residence or if it is rented out for more than 120 days per year, a commercial license is required. This regulation is part of an effort to prevent a shortage of long-term rental properties in the city.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top tourist destinations in the world, and it has one of the highest densities of Airbnb listings. The city's efforts to regulate short-term rentals through licensing are aimed at balancing the needs of tourists and local residents.
