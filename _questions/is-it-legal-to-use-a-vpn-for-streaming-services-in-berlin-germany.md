In Berlin, Germany, the legality of using a VPN to access streaming services depends on the specific circumstances and intentions behind its use. Generally, VPNs are legal in Germany for privacy and security purposes. However, using a VPN to circumvent geo-restrictions set by streaming services can violate the terms of service of those platforms. While not strictly illegal under German law, such actions can lead to the termination of your streaming service account if discovered. Furthermore, it is important to note that while the use of VPNs for legitimate privacy reasons is acceptable, engaging in illegal activities under the protection of a VPN remains against the law.

**Trivia:** Germany is known for its strict privacy laws and was one of the first countries to adopt data protection laws, setting a precedent for many other nations.
