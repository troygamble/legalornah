In Georgia, the legality of keeping chickens in a backyard depends on local ordinances rather than statewide laws. Each city or county in Georgia may have its own rules regarding the number of chickens allowed, the need for permits, restrictions on roosters due to noise concerns, and how the chicken area must be maintained to prevent nuisances or health hazards. For example, in some urban areas like Atlanta, residents are allowed to keep a certain number of chickens with specific requirements for coop size and placement relative to property lines and neighboring houses.

**Trivia:** Did you know that in many places, chickens are considered part of 'urban agriculture' movements that encourage self-sustainability? Some cities even have annual 'coop tours' where people showcase their backyard chicken setups.
