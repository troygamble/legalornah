In downtown Chicago, as in all of Illinois, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a valid permit. Illinois law mandates that individuals must possess a Concealed Carry License (CCL) to legally carry a concealed firearm. This requirement is part of the Illinois Firearm Concealed Carry Act, which was enacted to regulate the carrying of firearms in a concealed manner by private citizens. The process to obtain a CCL includes completing a firearms training course and passing a background check. Carrying a concealed weapon without meeting these requirements can result in significant legal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.

**Trivia:** Illinois was the last state in the United States to allow public possession of concealed guns. The state's Concealed Carry Law went into effect in July 2013 after a federal appeals court struck down the previous ban as unconstitutional.
