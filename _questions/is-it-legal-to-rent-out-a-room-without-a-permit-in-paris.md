In Paris, the legality of renting out a room without a permit can depend on several factors, including the duration of the rental and the type of accommodation. For short-term rentals, specifically those less than 120 days per year, the city requires homeowners to register with the town hall, obtaining a registration number that must be displayed on any rental listing. This is part of an effort to regulate vacation rentals that compete with the hotel industry and to prevent the conversion of residential housing into de facto hotels. For long-term rentals, different rules apply, and typically, such rentals do not require a special permit, but must adhere to standard housing regulations and laws regarding tenancy.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict housing regulations, partly due to the city's historical significance and the need to preserve its iconic landscapes and buildings. Interestingly, the city also has a unique legal concept known as 'bail mobilit√©' or mobility lease, introduced in 2018, which is aimed at facilitating temporary accommodation for people in mobility situations, such as training, studies, or temporary professional assignments.
