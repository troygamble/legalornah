In Mumbai, India, the legality of selling food from home without a license depends on several factors including the scale of the operation and the type of food being sold. Generally, individuals who wish to operate a small-scale or home-based food business must comply with regulations set by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The FSSAI mandates that any food business operator, regardless of the size of their business, must obtain an FSSAI registration or license. This requirement is intended to ensure that food products are safe for consumption and meet certain quality standards. For very small-scale operations or occasional selling, such as selling homemade food at a local event, the requirements may be less stringent, but it is advisable to check with local health departments or municipal authorities for specific local regulations.

**Trivia:** India's food regulation, particularly under the FSSAI, is known for its detailed guidelines that even cover aspects like food labeling and advertising, ensuring that consumers are well-informed about the food products they consume.
