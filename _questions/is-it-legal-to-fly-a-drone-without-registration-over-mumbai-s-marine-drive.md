In India, flying a drone without registration over Mumbai's Marine Drive is illegal. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) regulates the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, under the Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) issued in 2018. According to these regulations, all drones except for those in the Nano category (weighing less than 250 grams) must be registered with the DGCA. Marine Drive, being a populous urban area and close to several restricted zones such as military areas and government buildings, falls under a category where additional permissions from local authorities and the DGCA are required to operate drones.

**Trivia:** Marine Drive, also known as the Queen's Necklace due to its streetlights' resemblance to a string of pearls at night, is one of Mumbai's most iconic landmarks, making it a popular but sensitive location for aerial photography.
