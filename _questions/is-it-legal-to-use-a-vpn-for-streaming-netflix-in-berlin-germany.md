In Berlin, Germany, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) is generally legal, and many individuals and businesses use them for various legitimate purposes, including enhancing privacy and security. However, the legality of using a VPN for streaming content from platforms like Netflix can be complex. While there is no specific law that prohibits the use of VPNs to access Netflix, the issue arises from the terms of service of Netflix itself. Netflix's terms of service restrict the use of technology or software to access the service in a manner that is not authorized, including the use of VPNs to bypass geographical restrictions on content availability.

**Trivia:** Netflix began enforcing stricter measures against VPNs in 2016, which led to a significant decrease in the ability of users to access content not available in their own country. Despite these measures, the use of VPNs to access Netflix continues to be a popular method for accessing a wider range of content.
