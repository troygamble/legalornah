In Tokyo, Japan, selling food from a home kitchen is not straightforwardly legal or illegal; it depends on several regulatory compliances. According to the Food Sanitation Act of Japan, anyone who wishes to operate a food business, including selling homemade food, must obtain a food business license from the local government. This involves inspections to ensure that the kitchen meets health and sanitation standards comparable to commercial food establishments. Additionally, the operator must demonstrate knowledge of food safety practices, which can sometimes require attending a training course.

**Trivia:** In Japan, there is a cultural practice known as 'My Home Restaurant' where home cooks can invite guests into their homes to dine. This practice has grown in popularity and has influenced some regional regulations to become more accommodating to home-based food businesses.
