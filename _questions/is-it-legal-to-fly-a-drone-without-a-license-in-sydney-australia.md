In Sydney, Australia, whether you need a license to fly a drone depends on the purpose of the flight and the weight of the drone. Recreational users flying drones that weigh under 2 kilograms do not need a license, but must adhere to the safety rules set by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). These rules include not flying the drone higher than 120 meters, keeping it within visual line-of-sight, and not flying near emergency operations, among others. However, for commercial purposes or for drones weighing more than 2 kilograms, operators must obtain a Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) and operate under a Remote Operator's Certificate (ReOC) or fly in accordance with the excluded category rules as specified by CASA.

**Trivia:** Australia was one of the first countries to regulate the use of drones in the civilian airspace, with rules in place as early as 2002.
