In Japan, whether it is legal to fish without a license generally depends on the type of fishing and the specific location. For coastal areas around Tokyo, like many other regions, recreational fishing from the shore does not usually require a license. However, if you plan to engage in fishing using a boat or targeting specific species that are regulated, a license or permit may be necessary. Regulations can vary significantly, and some areas might be protected or have specific rules that limit fishing to preserve local marine ecosystems.

**Trivia:** Tokyo Bay, a major body of water adjacent to Tokyo, is famous for its diverse marine life and is a popular spot for both recreational and commercial fishing. Interestingly, Tokyo Bay has been undergoing various conservation efforts to improve its water quality and marine biodiversity, which had declined due to industrialization.
