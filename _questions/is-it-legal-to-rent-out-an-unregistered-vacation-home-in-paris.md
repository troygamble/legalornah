In Paris, it is illegal to rent out a vacation home that is not registered with the city authorities. The city of Paris requires all owners wishing to rent out their properties on a short-term basis to register with the local government. This registration process includes obtaining a registration number, which must be displayed in all rental advertisements. The purpose of this regulation is to ensure compliance with local housing laws, including those related to safety, zoning, and taxation. Failure to register can result in significant fines and penalties for the property owner.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these regulations partly to address concerns about housing shortages and the impact of short-term rentals on the local real estate market. The city has been known to actively enforce these rules, including conducting checks and imposing fines to ensure compliance.
