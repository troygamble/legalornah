In Sydney, as in the rest of Australia, the sale of homemade cosmetics is regulated under various national and state laws. These regulations are primarily concerned with ensuring that all cosmetic products sold to consumers are safe and properly labelled. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) enforces these standards under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, which includes the Australian Consumer Law (ACL). Manufacturers and sellers must ensure that their products do not contain prohibited substances and are free of contamination. Additionally, accurate labelling reflecting the ingredients and any potential allergens is mandatory. Approval per se might not be required, but compliance with these regulations is essential.

**Trivia:** Australia has been at the forefront of banning animal testing for cosmetics. This initiative reflects a growing global trend towards ethical and sustainable cosmetic production practices.
