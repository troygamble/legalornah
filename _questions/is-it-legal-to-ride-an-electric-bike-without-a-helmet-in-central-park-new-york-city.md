In New York City, the legality of riding an electric bike without a helmet depends on the age of the rider and the type of electric bike. New York State law requires that all electric bike riders under the age of 18 must wear a helmet. For those 18 years and older, helmets are not legally required when riding standard electric bikes (those that assist up to 20 mph). However, for Class 3 electric bikes, which can assist up to 25 mph and are only legal to ride on streets, all riders are required to wear helmets regardless of age. Central Park, being a public space, adheres to these general state and city regulations.

**Trivia:** Central Park is one of the most filmed locations in the world, appearing in over 350 films since 1908. This iconic park offers a scenic backdrop that's not only great for movies but also for leisurely bike rides, including those on electric bikes.
