In Sydney, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health permit. The local government requires all food businesses, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, to comply with the Food Act 2003 (NSW) and the Food Standards Code. These regulations ensure that food sold to the public is safe and handled in a hygienic manner. A health permit verifies that the food truck has met specific health standards, including proper food storage, preparation, and staff hygiene practices. Operating without such a permit can result in significant fines, legal action, and potential closure of the business.

**Trivia:** Sydney's vibrant food truck scene was boosted by a trial program launched by the City of Sydney in 2012, aiming to increase the variety and accessibility of high-quality street food available throughout the city.
