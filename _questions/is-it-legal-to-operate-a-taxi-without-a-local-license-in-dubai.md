In Dubai, it is illegal to operate a taxi without obtaining a local license from the relevant authorities. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) is the governing body responsible for regulating transportation services within Dubai, including taxis. The RTA mandates that all taxis must be licensed and adhere to specific regulations designed to ensure safety, reliability, and fairness in fare pricing. Operating a taxi without this license can result in penalties, fines, and possibly the impoundment of the vehicle used to provide such unauthorized services.

**Trivia:** Dubai is known for having one of the most luxurious taxi fleets in the world, including some taxis that are exclusively reserved for female passengers, driven by female drivers.
