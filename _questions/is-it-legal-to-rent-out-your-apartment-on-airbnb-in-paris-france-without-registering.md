In Paris, France, it is not legal to rent out an apartment on Airbnb without first registering the property with the city authorities. This regulation was implemented to manage the number of short-term rentals, which can affect the local housing market and community dynamics. The registration process involves obtaining a registration number, which must be displayed on all rental listings. This measure helps the city ensure that the property complies with housing regulations, including the rule that limits short-term rentals to a maximum of 120 days per year for primary residences.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top tourist destinations globally, and as such, it has one of the highest numbers of Airbnb listings in the world. The city's efforts to regulate Airbnb rentals are partly to preserve the character and accessibility of residential housing for Parisians.
