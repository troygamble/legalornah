In Scotland, as in the rest of the UK, it is illegal to use a handheld mobile phone while driving. This law applies regardless of whether the driver is stopped at traffic lights, in traffic, or actively moving. The law is designed to prevent distractions that could lead to accidents or unsafe driving conditions. Drivers are only allowed to use a mobile phone if they have hands-free access, such as a Bluetooth headset, voice command, or a dashboard holder, which allows them to keep their hands on the wheel and their attention on the road. However, even with hands-free devices, if the police believe youâ€™re distracted and not in control of your vehicle, you can still be penalized.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first mobile phone call in the UK was made by Ernie Wise to Vodafone's office in Newbury on 1 January 1985, marking the launch of the mobile phone network in the UK?
