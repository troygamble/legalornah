In Toronto, Canada, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a license. Canadian law strictly controls the possession, transportation, and carrying of firearms through the Firearms Act and the Criminal Code of Canada. Individuals must have a valid Possession and Acquisition Licence (PAL) to own a firearm, and carrying a concealed weapon typically requires an additional Restricted Possession and Acquisition Licence (RPAL) specifically for restricted firearms like handguns. Furthermore, even with these licenses, carrying a concealed weapon in public is heavily restricted and generally limited to certain professions such as law enforcement.

**Trivia:** Canada has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world, ranking 5th globally. However, its gun laws are much stricter compared to its southern neighbor, the United States, particularly regarding the carrying of concealed weapons.
