In Mumbai, operating a food truck requires obtaining specific permits and licenses from various local authorities. The primary regulatory body involved is the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), which enforces health and safety regulations. To legally operate a food truck, an owner must secure a Street Vending License under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, as well as other necessary permits such as a Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) license, and a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the local police and fire departments. These regulations are intended to ensure that food trucks meet health, safety, and environmental standards, thereby protecting public health and maintaining urban management.

**Trivia:** Food trucks in Mumbai offer a diverse range of cuisines reflecting the city's rich cultural mix. From local Maharashtrian dishes to international foods, these mobile eateries have become a popular and integral part of Mumbai's vibrant street food scene.
