In Sydney Harbour, the legality of fishing without a license depends on several factors including the type of fishing and the fisher's age or status. Generally, most individuals over the age of 18 are required to obtain a recreational fishing license to fish in New South Wales, which includes Sydney Harbour. This requirement is enforced to help manage fish populations and ensure sustainable fishing practices. However, there are exceptions; for instance, individuals under the age of 18, Aboriginal people, and pensioners may not need a license to fish. It's important for anyone planning to fish in Sydney Harbour to check the specific regulations that apply to their circumstances to ensure compliance with local laws.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is home to the Sydney Opera House, which is one of the most famous landmarks in the world. Interestingly, the Harbour also hosts an annual event known as the 'Sydney Harbour Regatta', which includes a variety of boat races and is a popular event for both participants and spectators.
