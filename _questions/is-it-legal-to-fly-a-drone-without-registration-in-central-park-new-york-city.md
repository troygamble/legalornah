Flying a drone in Central Park, New York City without registration is not legal. Federal regulations require that any drone weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) and less than 55 pounds (approx. 25 kilograms) must be registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) before it can be flown outdoors. This applies to recreational and commercial drone use. Additionally, New York City has strict local laws regarding the use of drones. The New York City Administrative Code generally prohibits the takeoff and landing of drones in any area that is not specifically designated for their use, which includes all NYC parks like Central Park, unless a special permit is obtained.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first known unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was an Austrian balloon used for bombing Venice in 1849? Drones have come a long way since then, now being used for a wide range of activities from photography to agriculture.
