In Sydney, the legality of renting out a house without a permit largely depends on the specific use of the property. For standard residential leases, where the property is rented out as a long-term residence, a permit is generally not required. However, if the property is being rented out for short-term accommodations, such as through Airbnb or other vacation rental platforms, the situation changes. Local councils in Sydney have specific regulations that may require homeowners to obtain a permit or comply with certain zoning and safety requirements. These regulations are designed to manage the impact of short-term rentals on local communities and ensure that all accommodations meet safety standards.

**Trivia:** Sydney's unique approach to short-term rental regulations was partly influenced by the city's hosting of the 2000 Olympic Games, which led to a surge in demand for temporary accommodations. This event significantly shaped local policies regarding temporary housing and rental regulations.
