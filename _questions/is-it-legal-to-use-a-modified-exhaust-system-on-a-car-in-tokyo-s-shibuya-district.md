In Tokyo's Shibuya district, as in the rest of Japan, the legality of using a modified exhaust system on a car depends on the type and extent of modifications made. Japanese law strictly regulates vehicle noise levels and emissions. The Road Transport Vehicle Act and the Noise Regulation Law are two key pieces of legislation that govern vehicle modifications. Modifications that cause a vehicle to exceed the permissible noise levels or fail to meet emission standards are illegal. This includes most aftermarket exhaust systems that are designed to increase the loudness or alter the sound of the exhaust.

**Trivia:** In Japan, car enthusiasts who modify their cars to enhance performance often participate in 'car meetings' where they showcase their vehicles' modifications. These gatherings are particularly popular in areas like Shibuya, which is known for its vibrant youth culture and fashion.
