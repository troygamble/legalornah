In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the use of drones for commercial purposes is regulated by the Civil Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Commercial drone operators are generally required to obtain a proper license or permit before flying a drone. This process involves submitting specific flight plans and ensuring that the drone does not fly in restricted areas, such as near airports or above crowded public spaces without special permission. The regulations are designed to ensure safety and privacy, and failure to comply can result in penalties.

**Trivia:** In Japan, there are designated areas known as 'drone parks' where people can freely fly drones. These parks are intended to encourage safe drone flying practices and innovation in drone technology.
