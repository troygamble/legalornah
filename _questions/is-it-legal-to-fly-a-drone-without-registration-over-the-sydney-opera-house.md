Flying a drone over the Sydney Opera House without registration is illegal. In Australia, drones that weigh over 250 grams must be registered with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) before they can be operated. Additionally, the Sydney Opera House is located within a controlled airspace due to its proximity to Sydney's central business district and tourist landmarks. This area is subject to stricter regulations to ensure safety and security. Drone operators must also comply with the rules that prohibit flying drones in or near areas with a high volume of public occupancy, such as the Sydney Opera House, without specific permissions.

**Trivia:** The Sydney Opera House is not only an architectural marvel but also a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2007. It hosts over 1,500 performances each year, attracting millions of visitors and making it one of the most photographed buildings in the world.
