In the state of Ohio, it is illegal to drive any motor vehicle without insurance or other proof of financial responsibility. The law requires all drivers to carry at least a minimum amount of liability insurance. This includes $25,000 for injury or death of one person, $50,000 for injury or death of two or more people, and $25,000 for property damage in any one accident. Failure to provide proof of insurance during a traffic stop or after an accident can result in penalties including fines, license suspension, and vehicle impoundment.

**Trivia:** Ohio is part of a database system known as the Ohio Automobile Insurance Plan, which helps ensure that vehicle owners and drivers are continuously able to meet their proof of financial responsibility.
