The legality of using a VPN to stream Netflix in Beijing, China, is not straightforward and depends on various factors. China has strict regulations on the use of VPNs, primarily aimed at controlling the information that can be accessed by its citizens. The government requires all VPN services to be licensed by the state, and unauthorized VPNs can be considered illegal. This means that while using a licensed VPN technically could be legal, most VPNs that can access services like Netflix are not state-approved, potentially putting users at risk of legal consequences.

**Trivia:** Despite the restrictions, Netflix does not officially operate in China. Instead, local streaming services like iQIYI, Tencent Video, and Youku are the dominant players in the Chinese market.
