In central Birmingham, UK, the legality of renting out a property without a landlord license depends on the specific area and the type of rental property. Birmingham City Council has designated certain areas as Selective Licensing areas, where a landlord must obtain a license to legally rent out a property. This licensing requirement is aimed at improving standards in the private rented sector. If the property is located within one of these designated areas, a landlord license is mandatory. Additionally, if the property is rented out as a House in Multiple Occupation (HMO), a separate HMO license may be required, regardless of its location within Birmingham.

**Trivia:** Birmingham was one of the first cities in the UK to implement selective licensing for landlords, a measure that was introduced to tackle issues of poor housing quality and high levels of transience in certain neighborhoods.
