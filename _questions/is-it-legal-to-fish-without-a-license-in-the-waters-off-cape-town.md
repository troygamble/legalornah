In Cape Town, as in most parts of South Africa, it is generally required to have a valid fishing license to fish in marine and inland waters. The requirement to have a license is governed by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which sets regulations to manage and sustain fish populations. Licenses are usually required for both recreational and commercial fishing to ensure that fishing activities do not lead to overfishing or harm to the aquatic environment. However, there might be certain exceptions or specific areas where fishing without a license is permitted, such as private ponds or during specific events where authorities temporarily waive the license requirement.

**Trivia:** Cape Town is known for its rich marine biodiversity and is a popular destination for both local and international anglers. The waters around Cape Town are home to a variety of fish species, including the sought-after Yellowtail and Snoek, which are popular targets for sport fishing.
