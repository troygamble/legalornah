In Germany, it is mandatory for all motorcycle riders and their passengers to wear helmets when riding on public roads. This regulation is enforced to ensure the safety of riders by reducing the risk of head injuries in the event of an accident. The law applies uniformly across the country, including in central Berlin. Failure to comply with this helmet law can result in penalties such as fines, and in some cases, may lead to more severe consequences like the suspension of driving privileges.

**Trivia:** Germany is known for its Autobahn, famous for sections without speed limits. However, despite the high speeds, safety regulations such as mandatory helmet laws for motorcycle riders are strictly enforced to maintain safety standards.
