In Dubai, the legality of flying a drone over private property depends on several factors including the purpose of the flight, the height at which the drone is flown, and whether specific permissions have been obtained. The Dubai Civil Aviation Authority (DCAA) regulates drone activities and requires operators to obtain a drone license for recreational or commercial use. For flights over private properties, drone operators must ensure they do not invade privacy or cause nuisance, which are considered legal violations under UAE laws.

**Trivia:** Dubai is known for its innovative use of drones in various sectors including delivery services and even for taxi drones, which are part of the city's futuristic transportation plans.
