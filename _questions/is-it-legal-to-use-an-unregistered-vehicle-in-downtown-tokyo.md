In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, it is illegal to operate an unregistered vehicle on public roads. Vehicle registration in Japan is a mandatory process that ensures all vehicles meet specific safety and environmental standards. This process also involves obtaining a valid vehicle inspection certificate known as 'Shaken', which is crucial for both new and used vehicles. The registration and inspection process helps maintain road safety and vehicle reliability, and driving an unregistered vehicle can lead to significant penalties including fines and potential impoundment of the vehicle.

**Trivia:** In Japan, vehicle license plates are color-coded to provide quick identification of the vehicle type. For instance, private vehicles have white plates with green text, while commercial vehicles display yellow plates with black text.
