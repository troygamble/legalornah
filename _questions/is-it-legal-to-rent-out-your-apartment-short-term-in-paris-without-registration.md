In Paris, renting out your apartment for short-term stays, typically through platforms like Airbnb, requires registration with the city authorities. This regulation was implemented to manage the increasing number of tourist accommodations which were affecting the local housing market. Apartment owners must obtain a registration number and display it on any online listings. The law aims to ensure that properties are not rented out for more than 120 days per year if it is the owner's primary residence. For non-primary residences, different and more stringent rules apply, often prohibiting short-term rentals entirely unless specific conditions are met.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world, and the regulation of short-term rentals was partly due to concerns that too many apartments being converted into tourist accommodations could lead to a shortage of long-term rental housing, affecting local residents' ability to find affordable housing.
