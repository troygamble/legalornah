In Sydney, as well as throughout Australia, operating a food truck without a health inspection certificate is illegal. Local councils require that all food businesses, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, must comply with the Food Standards Code. This code mandates that businesses must undergo regular health inspections to ensure that they meet the necessary food safety and hygiene standards. These inspections help protect public health by ensuring that food is safe to eat and is prepared in clean environments.

**Trivia:** Food trucks in Sydney are not only popular for their diverse and delicious offerings but have also been part of numerous food festivals and events, contributing significantly to the local culture and economy.
