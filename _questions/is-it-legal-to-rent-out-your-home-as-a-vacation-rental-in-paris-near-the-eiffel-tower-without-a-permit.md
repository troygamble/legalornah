In Paris, the legality of renting out your home as a vacation rental, especially in areas near major tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower, depends on several regulatory requirements. Homeowners must register with the city authorities to obtain a registration number, which must be displayed in all rental advertisements. This registration helps the city monitor and control the number of days a property is rented out, as there is a limit of 120 days per year for primary residences. Additionally, if the property is not your primary residence, a change of use permit is required, which involves converting the property's status from residential to commercial. This process is often complex and may require approval from other owners in the building if it's part of a co-owned property.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on vacation rentals, largely in response to concerns that short-term rentals were contributing to housing shortages and rising rents in central areas. The city has even implemented a dedicated team to track and penalize unauthorized vacation rentals.
