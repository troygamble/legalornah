In Mumbai, the legality of installing security cameras in residential areas without consent depends on several factors, including the location of the cameras and the purpose of surveillance. According to Indian privacy laws and the Information Technology Act, 2000, individuals have a right to privacy, which includes areas where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as inside their homes. Cameras installed in public areas of a residential complex, like entrances or common areas, are generally permissible if they are intended for security purposes and do not invade individual privacy by pointing directly into someone's private space, such as inside their home.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the world's largest CCTV network is in China, with over 200 million cameras installed for public surveillance as of 2021? This extensive network is used for a range of purposes, from traffic management to public safety.
