In Sydney, the legality of renting out your home on a short-term basis without a license depends on several factors including the local government area and specific zoning regulations. Generally, the New South Wales government allows short-term rental accommodation (STRA) but imposes certain conditions. For instance, there are restrictions on how many days per year a property can be rented out short-term if the host is not present, which is capped at 180 days in the Greater Sydney area. Additionally, hosts are required to register their property with the NSW government's STRA Register, ensuring compliance with fire safety and planning regulations.

**Trivia:** Did you know that Sydney's iconic Opera House was designed by Danish architect JÃ¸rn Utzon and opened in 1973? It's a popular spot for tourists, many of whom stay in short-term rental properties during their visit.
