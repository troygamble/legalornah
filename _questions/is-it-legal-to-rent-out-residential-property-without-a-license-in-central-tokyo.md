In central Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the legality of renting out residential property without a specific license generally depends on the nature of the rental. For standard long-term rentals, no special license is typically required beyond ensuring compliance with local zoning laws and building codes. However, for short-term rentals, often referred to as 'minpaku' in Japan, a national law enacted in 2018 requires property owners to register with the local government and obtain a license if they wish to rent out their homes for short stays (less than 30 days). This licensing requirement was introduced to address concerns related to safety, nuisance, and competition with the hotel industry.

**Trivia:** The 'minpaku' law in Japan includes an interesting provision that limits the number of days a property can be rented out on a short-term basis to 180 days per year, a rule designed to balance the needs of tourists and local residents.
