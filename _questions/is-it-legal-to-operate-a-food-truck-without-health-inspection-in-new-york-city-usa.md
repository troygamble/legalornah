In New York City, operating a food truck without a health inspection is illegal. The city mandates that all mobile food vendors undergo health inspections to ensure they meet the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's standards. These inspections check for cleanliness, proper food handling, and storage practices to protect public health. Additionally, food truck operators must obtain a Mobile Food Vending License and a Mobile Food Vending Permit, both of which require passing a health inspection before issuance. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in fines, permit revocation, and the inability to legally operate within the city.

**Trivia:** New York City's food truck scene is not only a hub of diverse culinary offerings but also a fiercely competitive market. The city's first food truck was reportedly an ice cream truck in the mid-20th century, and since then, the number of food trucks has grown exponentially, serving everything from gourmet meals to ethnic specialties.
