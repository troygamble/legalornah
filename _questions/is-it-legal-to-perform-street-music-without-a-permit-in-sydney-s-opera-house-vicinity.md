In Sydney, the legality of performing street music without a permit in the vicinity of the Opera House depends on specific local regulations and the area's zoning laws. The City of Sydney requires buskers to obtain a permit to perform in public spaces to ensure that public performances do not disrupt local businesses, residents, and traffic. The regulations are in place to manage noise levels, safety, and the general use of public spaces. Permits are issued by the City Council and may have restrictions based on location, time, and type of performance. Therefore, performing near the Sydney Opera House, a high-profile venue and tourist attraction, typically requires adherence to these regulations.

**Trivia:** The Sydney Opera House, besides being an iconic architectural marvel, hosts over 1,500 performances each year, attracting an audience of around 1.2 million people. This makes the surrounding area a prime location for street performers seeking exposure to a diverse and international crowd.
