In Paris, France, operating a food truck without a permit is illegal. The city requires all food truck operators to obtain specific permits and licenses to ensure compliance with health, safety, and zoning regulations. These permits include a general business license, a food handling permit, and often a specific permit for mobile food vending. The process is designed to maintain public health standards and manage the city's public spaces effectively. Without these permits, a food truck operator can face fines, penalties, and possibly the confiscation of their vehicle.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on street vendors, including food trucks. This is part of an effort to preserve the city's historic and aesthetic appeal, which is a significant draw for millions of tourists each year.
