In Frankfurt, as in the rest of Germany, the legality of using a VPN for streaming depends on the content being accessed and how it is being accessed. VPNs are legal in Germany and are commonly used for enhancing security and privacy online. However, using a VPN to access geo-restricted content, such as streaming services that are not licensed to operate in Germany, can violate the terms of service of those streaming platforms. While not typically a legal violation in terms of criminal law, breaching the terms of service can lead to consequences such as being banned from using the service.

**Trivia:** Germany is known for its strict privacy laws and was one of the first countries to adopt data protection legislation, with the first act dating back to 1970 in the state of Hesse, which includes Frankfurt.
