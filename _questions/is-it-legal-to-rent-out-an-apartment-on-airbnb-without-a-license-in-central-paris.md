In central Paris, the legality of renting out an apartment on Airbnb without a license depends on several factors, primarily the duration and frequency of the rental. According to Parisian regulations, if you are renting out your primary residence (where you live for at least 8 months a year), you can do so for up to 120 days per year without a special license. However, if you rent it out for more than 120 days per year or if it is not your primary residence, you are required to register the property with the city officials and obtain a commercial use authorization. This transformation of residential space into commercial accommodation requires approval to ensure compliance with local housing laws and tax regulations.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most active markets for Airbnb, with thousands of listings across the city. The stringent regulations were introduced not only to preserve housing but also in response to concerns from hoteliers about competition. Interestingly, during major events like Paris Fashion Week or the French Open, the demand for short-term rentals spikes, making it a lucrative time for Airbnb hosts in the city.
