In France, including central Paris, it is illegal to fly a drone without proper registration and adherence to specific regulations set by the French government. The French Civil Aviation Authority (Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile, DGAC) mandates that all drone operators must register their drones if they weigh more than 800 grams. Furthermore, central Paris is classified as a no-fly zone for drones due to security and privacy concerns, as well as the potential risk to air traffic. Flying a drone in this area without explicit authorization from the relevant authorities can lead to significant fines and legal consequences.

**Trivia:** France was one of the first countries to regulate the use of drones within its airspace, reflecting its proactive stance on managing this emerging technology. Additionally, Paris hosts an annual event called the Paris Drone Festival, where drone enthusiasts gather to showcase their flying skills and the latest drone technology, albeit in a controlled environment.
