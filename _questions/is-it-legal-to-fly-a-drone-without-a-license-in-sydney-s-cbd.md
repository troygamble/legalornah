Flying a drone in Sydney's CBD is subject to strict regulations due to safety, privacy, and security concerns. Under the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) regulations, recreational drone pilots typically do not need a license if they adhere to the standard operating conditions. These include flying during daylight, within visual line-of-sight, and not above crowds. However, Sydney's CBD is a densely populated area, and flying a drone there could easily breach these conditions, particularly the rule against flying over populous areas. Additionally, any drone operation for commercial purposes requires obtaining a Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) and operating within an organisation holding a Remote Operator's Certificate (ReOC).

**Trivia:** Australia was one of the first countries to regulate the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) back in 2002, recognizing early on the potential and risks associated with drone technology.
