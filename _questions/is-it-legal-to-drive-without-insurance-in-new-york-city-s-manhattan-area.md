In New York City, including the Manhattan area, it is illegal to drive without vehicle insurance. New York State requires all motor vehicles registered in the state to have liability insurance. The minimum insurance coverage required includes $25,000 for bodily injury to one person, $50,000 for bodily injury to all persons, and $10,000 for property damage in any one accident. Failure to carry valid auto insurance can result in severe penalties including fines, the suspension of one's driver's license and vehicle registration, and potential impoundment of the vehicle.

**Trivia:** New York was the first state in the U.S. to require automobile liability insurance. This law was enacted in 1956.
