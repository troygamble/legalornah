In Sydney, the legality of renting out a property on Airbnb without registering depends on several factors, including the type of property and the duration of the rental. As of recent regulations, hosts are required to register their properties with the New South Wales government if they wish to rent them out for short-term accommodations. This registration process involves complying with specific safety and insurance requirements to ensure the property meets certain standards. Additionally, there are restrictions on how many days per year a property can be rented out on short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, which is capped at 180 days in the Greater Sydney area.

**Trivia:** Airbnb was founded in 2008, and the idea was born when its founders rented out air mattresses in their living room to help pay their rent!
