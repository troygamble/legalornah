In Massachusetts, it is legal for individuals to grow cannabis at home for personal use. The law permits adults aged 21 and over to cultivate up to six cannabis plants per person, with a maximum of 12 plants per household. These plants must be grown in an area that is not visible from a public place and must be secured to prevent unauthorized access, particularly by minors.

**Trivia:** Massachusetts was the first state on the East Coast to legalize recreational cannabis through a ballot initiative in 2016.
