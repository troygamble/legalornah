In San Francisco, including the Mission District, the legality of renting out a home without a permit depends on several factors, including the type of rental and the duration. For short-term rentals (less than 30 days), a permit is required from the San Francisco Office of Short-Term Rentals. This regulation was implemented to ensure that rental properties comply with local housing and safety codes, and to mitigate the impact of short-term rentals on the local housing market. For long-term rentals, generally, a specific permit may not be required, but landlords must comply with local housing codes and regulations, which could involve obtaining business licenses or passing building and safety inspections.

**Trivia:** San Francisco's Mission District is known for its vibrant street murals. Many of these artworks depict social and political themes relevant to the community, including housing rights and gentrification issues, which are hot topics in the area due to the impact of the tech industry on local housing markets.
