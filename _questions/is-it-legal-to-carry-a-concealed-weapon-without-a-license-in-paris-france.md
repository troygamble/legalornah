In France, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a license. French law strictly regulates the possession, use, and carrying of firearms and other weapons under the Internal Security Code. To legally carry a concealed weapon, an individual must obtain a specific authorization, which is generally reserved for law enforcement and certain security personnel. The process for obtaining such authorization is stringent, requiring thorough background checks, training, and a demonstrated need for personal protection. Unauthorized possession or carrying of a weapon can lead to significant legal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.

**Trivia:** France has one of the highest rates of private gun ownership in the world, but despite this, the laws governing the use and carrying of firearms are very strict compared to countries like the United States.
