In Tokyo, the legality of renting out a property without a license largely depends on the type of rental activity being conducted. For standard residential rentals, a specific license is not generally required. However, if the property is being rented out as a 'minpaku' (private lodging or vacation rental), such as those often listed on platforms like Airbnb, a license is indeed necessary under the 'Minpaku Law' that came into effect in June 2018. This law mandates that operators must register with the local government and adhere to various regulations, including a cap on the number of days a property can be rented out to short-term guests, which is currently set at 180 days per year.

**Trivia:** Tokyo's implementation of the Minpaku Law was largely in response to the rapid increase in tourists leading up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, which prompted concerns about the shortage of hotel accommodations and the impact of short-term rentals on residential communities.
