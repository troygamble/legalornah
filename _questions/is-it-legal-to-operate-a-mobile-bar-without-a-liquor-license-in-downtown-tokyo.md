In Japan, the sale of alcohol is regulated under the Liquor Tax Law and the Law Concerning Liquor Business Associations. According to these regulations, any business that wishes to sell alcohol must obtain a liquor license. This requirement applies to all types of establishments, including mobile bars. Operating a mobile bar in downtown Tokyo without a liquor license is illegal and can lead to severe penalties including fines and imprisonment. The licensing process is managed by the National Tax Agency in Japan, and the specific requirements can vary depending on the type of alcohol being sold and the nature of the business.

**Trivia:** Tokyo has a vibrant nightlife culture, and the district of Shinjuku is famous for its small bars, some of which are so tiny that they can only seat a few customers at a time. These miniature establishments, often found in the Golden Gai area, create a uniquely intimate drinking experience.
