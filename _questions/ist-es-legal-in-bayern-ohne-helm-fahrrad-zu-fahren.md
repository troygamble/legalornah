In Bayern, as well as throughout Germany, it is legal to ride a bicycle without wearing a helmet. The German traffic laws (Stra√üenverkehrs-Ordnung, StVO) do not mandate the use of helmets for bicycle riders of any age. This regulation is based on the principle of personal freedom and responsibility. However, it is highly recommended by safety experts and medical professionals to wear a helmet while cycling to reduce the risk of head injuries in the event of an accident.

**Trivia:** Despite the absence of a legal requirement, Germany has a high rate of voluntary helmet usage, especially among children and sports cyclists. The country also has extensive bicycle paths and dedicated lanes, making it one of the more bike-friendly countries in Europe.
