In New York City, it is generally illegal to fly a drone without FAA registration, provided the drone weighs more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) and less than 55 pounds. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires all drone operators to register their drones if they fall within this weight range. Registration involves providing personal details and paying a fee, which then allows the FAA to track the drone's ownership in cases of misuse or violation of airspace regulations. Furthermore, New York City has stringent local laws regarding drone use, largely prohibiting their operation in most parts of the city due to safety and privacy concerns, particularly in densely populated areas and near airports.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first FAA-approved drone delivery in the United States occurred in July 2015, when medical supplies were delivered to a rural health clinic in Virginia?
