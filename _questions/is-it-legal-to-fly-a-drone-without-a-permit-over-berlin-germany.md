In Germany, the legality of flying a drone without a permit over Berlin depends on several factors including the weight of the drone, the purpose of the flight, and the specific area over which the drone is flown. Drones weighing less than 5 kilograms may generally be flown without a special permit for recreational purposes, but there are strict regulations regarding where they can be flown. For instance, flying near airports, in no-fly zones, or over crowds is prohibited. Furthermore, drones that weigh more than 2 kilograms require the operator to have proof of knowledge, often referred to as a 'drone license'.

**Trivia:** Berlin has several designated areas known as 'model airfields' where hobbyists can fly their drones and model aircraft legally, which are often equipped with safety measures and provide a community for drone enthusiasts to share tips and experiences.
