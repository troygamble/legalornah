In Colorado, the legality of collecting rainwater is subject to specific regulations and conditions. Historically, due to the state's prior appropriation water rights system, collecting rainwater was largely illegal because it was considered interference with the natural flow of water, which could affect downstream water rights holders. However, laws have evolved, and as of recent legislation, residents in Colorado can collect rainwater under certain conditions. Households with rooftops can collect rainwater if they use rain barrels or similar collection systems, and the water must be used on the property where it is collected, primarily for outdoor purposes such as gardening and lawn care.

**Trivia:** Did you know? Colorado was one of the last states in the U.S. to legalize rainwater collection for personal use, reflecting its unique and complex water rights system which dates back to the mining days of the 19th century.
