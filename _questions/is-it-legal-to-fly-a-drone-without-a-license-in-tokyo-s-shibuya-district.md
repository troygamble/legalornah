In Tokyo's Shibuya district, as in the rest of Japan, the legality of flying a drone without a license depends on several factors including the weight of the drone and the area where it is operated. Drones weighing 200 grams or more require the operator to register with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) and to follow specific safety guidelines. Additionally, flying drones in densely populated areas or near airports without prior permission is strictly prohibited. Special permissions are needed to operate drones in these restricted areas, and failure to comply with these regulations can result in penalties.

**Trivia:** Did you know that in Japan, there are drone racing events where pilots navigate their drones through complex courses at high speeds? This sport has gained popularity not only as a hobby but also as a competitive event.
