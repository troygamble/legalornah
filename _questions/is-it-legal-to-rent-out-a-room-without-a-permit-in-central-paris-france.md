In central Paris, France, the legality of renting out a room without a permit largely depends on the duration of the rental and the type of accommodation. For short-term rentals, particularly those less than 120 days per year, individuals are required to register the property with the city authorities. This is especially enforced for rentals offered through platforms like Airbnb. The city has implemented this regulation to manage the availability of housing and prevent long-term rental shortages. For long-term rentals, different rules apply, and typically, a permit is not necessary, but landlords must comply with standard rental regulations and ensure the property meets housing standards.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stringent regulations on short-term rentals after noticing a significant impact on the local housing market and to preserve the character of residential neighborhoods amidst the surge of tourists seeking accommodations.
