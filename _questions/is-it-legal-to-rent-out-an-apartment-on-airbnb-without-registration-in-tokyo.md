In Tokyo, renting out an apartment on Airbnb or similar platforms is subject to specific regulations under Japan's Minpaku law, which came into effect in June 2018. This law requires hosts to register with the local government and obtain a license before listing their property for short-term rental. The law was implemented to address concerns about safety, noise, and the impact on residential communities. Hosts must also adhere to local rules, which can vary by municipality. For example, there may be restrictions on the number of days per year an apartment can be rented out and requirements to manage guests' behavior.

**Trivia:** Tokyo implemented these regulations in response to a tourism boom and the upcoming global events such as the Olympics, aiming to ensure sufficient and proper lodging for visitors while balancing the needs of local residents.
