In Virginia, the legality of carrying a concealed weapon without a permit depends on several factors including the type of weapon and the individual's specific circumstances. Generally, Virginia law requires individuals to have a valid concealed handgun permit to carry a concealed handgun. However, there are exceptions for certain individuals such as law enforcement officers and military personnel. It is important to note that carrying a concealed weapon without a permit when required can result in criminal charges.

**Trivia:** Virginia was one of the first states to adopt a 'shall-issue' permit system, which requires that a concealed carry permit be issued to any applicant who meets specific, predetermined criteria.
