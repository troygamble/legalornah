In Paris, France, it is legally required for all motorbike riders and their passengers to wear a helmet. This requirement is enforced under French national traffic laws, specifically under the Road Traffic Act, which mandates helmets to meet European safety standard regulations. The law applies uniformly across all regions of France, including Paris, and is designed to protect riders from head injuries in the event of an accident. Failure to wear a helmet while operating or riding on a motorbike can result in fines and points on the driver's license.

**Trivia:** France not only requires motorbike helmets to be worn at all times but also mandates that these helmets must have reflective stickers on all four sides. This regulation aims to improve the visibility of motorcyclists, particularly in low-light conditions, enhancing safety for both the riders and other road users.
