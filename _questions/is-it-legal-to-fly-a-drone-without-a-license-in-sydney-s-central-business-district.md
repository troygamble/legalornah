In Sydney's Central Business District (CBD), it is illegal to fly a drone without the appropriate license or authorization. Australian drone laws, governed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), require operators to follow specific safety rules, which include not flying drones in populous areas or near other aircraft without permission. The CBD, being a densely populated area and close to helipads and flight paths, typically falls under these restrictions. Operators must hold an appropriate Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) or be flying under the umbrella of an organization with an Operator's Certificate, depending on the size of the drone and the nature of the flight.

**Trivia:** Australia was one of the first countries to regulate the use of drones in civilian airspace, introducing its first drone laws as early as 2002.
