In Mumbai, as in other cities in India, operating a food truck requires adherence to certain health and safety regulations, including obtaining a health license. This license is crucial to ensure that the food served to the public meets safety standards and is free from contamination. The license is issued by the local municipal corporation, in this case, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which follows guidelines set forth by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The FSSAI mandates that all food business operators, including mobile units like food trucks, must obtain a registration or license depending on the size and nature of their business.

**Trivia:** Mumbai, often seen as the culinary capital of India, has a thriving street food culture. The city's food trucks offer a variety of cuisines, reflecting Mumbai's diverse culture and culinary innovation. Interestingly, Mumbai hosted its first ever Food Truck Festival in 2017, celebrating the gourmet food truck culture.
