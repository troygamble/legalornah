In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) is legal. However, the legality of using a VPN for streaming services specifically depends on the terms of service of the streaming platform and the intent behind using the VPN. Many streaming services have terms that restrict the use of tools like VPNs to bypass geo-restrictions and access content not available in a user's region. This is primarily due to licensing agreements that these services have with content providers, which are often restricted to specific geographical areas. Therefore, while using a VPN in itself is not illegal, using it to access geo-restricted content may violate the terms of service of the streaming platform, potentially leading to the suspension or termination of the user's account.

**Trivia:** Japan is known for its strong internet infrastructure and high-speed internet connections, often ranking among the top countries globally for internet speed. This makes streaming services particularly popular in urban areas like Tokyo.
