In Toronto, as in the rest of Ontario, it is illegal to operate an unregistered vehicle on public roads, including downtown areas. The Highway Traffic Act of Ontario requires all motor vehicles to be registered with the Ministry of Transportation. This registration process involves obtaining a vehicle permit, license plates, and a validation tag, which must be renewed periodically. Driving an unregistered vehicle can result in fines and penalties, including the impoundment of the vehicle.

**Trivia:** Toronto was the first city in the world to computerize its traffic signals to adapt to real-time traffic conditions back in the 1960s.
