In Paris, the legality of renting out your home on a short-term basis without a permit depends on several factors. Homeowners who wish to rent their primary residence can do so for up to 120 days per year without a special permit. However, they must register with the city hall to obtain a registration number, which must be clearly displayed in all rental advertisements. This rule is aimed at preventing the conversion of residential housing into full-time vacation rentals, which can affect local housing markets and community dynamics. For secondary residences, or if renting beyond the 120-day limit, homeowners are required to change the property's use from residential to commercial, which involves applying for a permit and possibly facing stricter regulations and higher taxes.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world, attracting millions of tourists each year. The city's administration has implemented strict regulations on short-term rentals to preserve the local housing stock and maintain the character of residential neighborhoods, amidst concerns that neighborhoods were being overrun by temporary visitors.
