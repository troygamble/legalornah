In Shibuya, Tokyo, it is generally illegal to sell merchandise on the street without a vendor's license. The local regulations in Tokyo require street vendors to obtain a proper license from municipal authorities before they can legally sell goods or services on public streets. This licensing process involves a review of the type of merchandise being sold, the specific location of the street vending, and compliance with local laws and regulations. These measures are in place to manage public spaces, ensure safety, and prevent congestion.

**Trivia:** Shibuya is famous for its bustling atmosphere and vibrant street life, including the iconic Shibuya Crossing, one of the busiest pedestrian crossings in the world. Despite its lively street culture, the area maintains strict regulations to ensure that street vending does not disrupt the flow of people and traffic.
