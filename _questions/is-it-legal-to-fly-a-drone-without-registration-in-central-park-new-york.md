In Central Park, New York, it is illegal to fly a drone without registration, and generally, drone flying is heavily restricted. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), all drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) and less than 55 pounds (approx. 25 kilograms) must be registered. Additionally, New York City Parks Department prohibits the operation of drones in all city parks, including Central Park, except in designated model aircraft fields, which Central Park does not have. Violating these regulations can lead to fines and other penalties. Drone operators must also comply with FAA regulations, which include flying at certain altitudes and away from restricted airspace.

**Trivia:** Central Park, despite its vast size and popularity, does not have any designated areas for flying drones. This is in contrast to some other cities that have specific parks or areas where drone flying is allowed under certain conditions.
