Using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for streaming services in downtown Tokyo, or anywhere in Japan, is not explicitly illegal. However, the legality can depend on the purpose for which the VPN is used. VPNs are commonly used for enhancing online privacy and security by encrypting internet traffic and masking the user's IP address. This is generally legal in Japan. However, using a VPN to access geo-restricted content, such as streaming services not available in Japan, can violate the terms of service of many streaming platforms. While not necessarily illegal under Japanese law, this could lead to the suspension or termination of your account with the streaming service.

**Trivia:** Japan is known for its stringent copyright laws, which were further strengthened in 2012 to include penalties for downloading copyrighted material illegally. However, there is no specific law that targets the use of VPNs for accessing geo-restricted content.
