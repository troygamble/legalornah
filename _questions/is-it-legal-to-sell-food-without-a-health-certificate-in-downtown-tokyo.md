In downtown Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, it is illegal to sell food without a valid health certificate. The Food Sanitation Act of Japan mandates that any business involved in the sale, production, or preparation of food must obtain a health certificate. This certificate ensures that the business complies with the necessary hygiene standards and that the staff involved in food handling have undergone appropriate health and safety training. The local health departments are responsible for issuing these certificates and conducting regular inspections to ensure compliance with the health regulations.

**Trivia:** Tokyo is known for its strict food safety regulations, which contribute to its reputation for having some of the world's highest quality and safest cuisine. The city frequently hosts training programs for food safety, emphasizing the importance of hygiene in both traditional and modern culinary practices.
