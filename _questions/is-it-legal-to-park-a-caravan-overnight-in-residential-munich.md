In Munich, the legality of parking a caravan overnight in residential areas is subject to specific regulations and can vary depending on the exact location and circumstances. Generally, parking a caravan for a short period, such as overnight, is permissible on public streets where parking is allowed, unless there are specific signs that prohibit parking of caravans. However, this is typically only intended for temporary stops and not for permanent or semi-permanent residence. Extended parking or living in a caravan on a public street or in residential areas can be subject to local zoning laws and may require special permits from municipal authorities.

**Trivia:** Munich is known for its strict regulations on public order and cleanliness, often referred to as 'Ordnung muss sein' (There must be order), which extends to the use of public spaces including streets and parking.
