In Bangalore, the installation of solar panels typically requires adherence to specific regulations and often necessitates government approval, particularly if the installation is on a large scale or involves grid connection. The Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Ltd (KREDL) and Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM) are key bodies that regulate solar installations in the region. For residential properties, the process might be more streamlined, especially under schemes promoting solar energy. However, for commercial installations or larger setups, obtaining approval from BESCOM and ensuring compliance with building codes and safety standards is mandatory. This often involves submitting detailed project reports and undergoing inspections to ensure adherence to technical and safety norms.

**Trivia:** Bangalore, often touted as the Silicon Valley of India, is also making strides in becoming a green city. The city has witnessed a significant increase in solar installations in recent years, driven by both governmental incentives and growing environmental consciousness among its residents.
