In Tokyo, Japan, the legality of fishing without a license primarily depends on the type of fishing and the specific area where the fishing is taking place. For recreational fishing in coastal areas and public waters, licenses are generally not required for locals and tourists using simple gear like rods and lines. However, if the fishing involves commercial activities, or the use of specific equipment that could impact the marine environment or fish populations significantly, a license is typically required. Additionally, certain protected areas might have stricter regulations, requiring permits or imposing limitations on fishing to preserve the local ecosystem.

**Trivia:** Tokyo Bay, a major fishing area in coastal Tokyo, is famous not only for its scenic views but also for hosting a variety of fish species, making it a popular spot for both casual and serious anglers.
