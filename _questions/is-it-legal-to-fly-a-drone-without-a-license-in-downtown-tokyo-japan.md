In Japan, the legality of flying a drone without a license in downtown Tokyo depends on several factors, including the size of the drone and the specific area where it is being flown. Generally, drones weighing more than 200 grams require the operator to obtain a license from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Additionally, Tokyo has stringent regulations regarding drone flights in densely populated areas and near critical infrastructure such as airports and government buildings. Specific no-fly zones have been established, and flying drones in these areas without proper authorization can lead to legal penalties.

**Trivia:** In 2015, a drone carrying radioactive material landed on the roof of the Japanese Prime Minister's office, leading to stricter drone regulations across the country.
