In Singapore, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) is generally legal. However, the legality of using a VPN for streaming content hinges on the content being accessed and the means through which it is obtained. Singapore's laws, especially the Copyright Act, prohibit accessing copyrighted materials without proper authorization. Therefore, if a VPN is used to circumvent geo-restrictions to access copyrighted content from streaming services that are not licensed in Singapore, this could potentially be considered an infringement of copyright laws. Additionally, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) regulates media content and internet practices in Singapore, and using a VPN to access restricted or censored content might violate specific regulations or guidelines set by IMDA.

**Trivia:** Singapore was one of the first countries in Southeast Asia to implement a nationwide fiber-based broadband network, which significantly enhanced internet speeds and connectivity, paving the way for high-demand streaming services.
