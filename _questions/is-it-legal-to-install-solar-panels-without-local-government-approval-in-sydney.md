title: "Is it legal to install solar panels without local government approval in Sydney?"
short_answer: "Depends"

In Sydney, the installation of solar panels generally requires approval from the local government, particularly through the development application process or complying development certificates. This is because solar panel installations can affect building structure, aesthetics, and neighborhood character. However, for certain types of properties and specific installations that meet predefined criteria, the process might be streamlined under the Exempt and Complying Development Codes in the New South Wales legislation. This means that if the installation falls within certain size limitations and meets specific conditions, it may not require a formal approval process, thereby simplifying the procedure.

**Trivia:** Australia is one of the world leaders in the usage of solar energy per capita, largely due to its abundant sunshine and supportive government policies aimed at promoting renewable energy.
