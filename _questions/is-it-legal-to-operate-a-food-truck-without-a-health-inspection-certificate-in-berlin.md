In Berlin, as in the rest of Germany, operating a food truck requires compliance with various health and safety regulations, including obtaining a health inspection certificate. This certificate ensures that the food truck meets the necessary hygiene standards set by local health authorities. The process includes inspections of food handling, storage, preparation areas, and overall cleanliness of the vehicle to protect public health. Without this certificate, a food truck operator risks facing legal penalties, fines, or even closure of their business by local authorities.

**Trivia:** Berlin is known for its diverse food culture, and food trucks play a significant role in this. They often gather at popular events like street food markets or festivals, offering a variety of cuisines from around the world.
