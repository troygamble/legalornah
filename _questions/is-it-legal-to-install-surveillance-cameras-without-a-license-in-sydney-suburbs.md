In Sydney, as in most parts of Australia, the legality of installing surveillance cameras without a license largely depends on the context in which they are being used. Generally, individuals and businesses do not need a license to install surveillance cameras for security purposes on their own property. However, there are strict privacy laws that must be adhered to. It is crucial that the cameras do not invade anyone's privacy by capturing images or audio from public spaces or neighboring properties without consent. The Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) governs the use of surveillance devices, including cameras, ensuring that they are used in a manner that respects the privacy of others.

**Trivia:** Did you know that Sydney was one of the first cities in Australia to adopt widespread use of CCTV systems in public spaces? This was initially implemented to enhance security during the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.
