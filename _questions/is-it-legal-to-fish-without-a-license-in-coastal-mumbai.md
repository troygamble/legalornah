In Mumbai, as in many parts of India, the legality of fishing without a license depends on the location and the type of fishing you intend to engage in. Coastal fishing regulations are governed by both state and national laws. The Maharashtra Maritime Board and the Department of Fisheries oversee fishing activities and enforce regulations that aim to manage and conserve fish populations. Generally, commercial fishing requires a license, and there are specific rules that regulate the size of the catch, the type of gear used, and the seasons during which fishing is allowed. Recreational fishing, particularly from the shore, may not always require a license, but it is subject to local regulations that can vary.

**Trivia:** Mumbai is known for its diverse marine life and is a popular spot for both commercial and recreational fishing. The city's coastline, stretching along the Arabian Sea, hosts a variety of fish species, making it a vibrant hub for fishermen and seafood enthusiasts.
