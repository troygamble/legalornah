In Rio de Janeiro, as in the rest of Brazil, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. Brazilian law, governed by the Statute of Disarmament (Lei No. 10.826/03), strictly controls the possession and carrying of firearms. Individuals must meet specific criteria to be eligible for a firearm permit, which includes being at least 25 years old, having a clean criminal record, demonstrating the necessity of carrying a weapon, and passing psychological and technical tests. Even with a permit, carrying firearms in public places is heavily regulated and generally restricted to law enforcement officers and certain other authorized personnel.

**Trivia:** Brazil's gun control policies are among some of the strictest in South America. Despite this, the country has one of the highest rates of gun-related deaths in the world, which has spurred ongoing debates about the effectiveness and enforcement of existing gun laws.
