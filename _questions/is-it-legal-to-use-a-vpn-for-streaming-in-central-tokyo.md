In Japan, using a VPN to stream content is generally legal, including in central Tokyo. VPNs are widely used for various purposes such as enhancing security, ensuring privacy, and accessing geographically restricted content. Japanese law does not prohibit the use of VPNs for lawful activities, including streaming. However, it's important to note that while the use of VPNs themselves is legal, accessing content through a VPN that violates copyright laws, such as streaming pirated content, remains illegal under Japanese copyright laws.

**Trivia:** Japan is known for its strong internet infrastructure and high speeds, making it an ideal location for streaming high-quality video content. Tokyo, in particular, has some of the fastest internet speeds in the world.
