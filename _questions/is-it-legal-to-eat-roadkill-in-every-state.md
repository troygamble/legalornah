The legality of eating roadkill varies by state in the United States. Some states have specific laws that allow for the collection and consumption of animals killed by vehicles, provided that certain conditions are met. These conditions often include reporting the collection to state authorities, obtaining necessary permits, or ensuring the animal is part of a species that can be legally consumed. States like Alaska, Illinois, and West Virginia have regulations that permit the salvaging of roadkill under specific guidelines.

**Trivia:** In some states, roadkill salvaging laws were enacted to prevent the wastage of potentially good meat and to help remove carcasses from roadways, which can pose safety hazards to other drivers.
