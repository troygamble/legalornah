In Miami, as in the rest of Florida, the legality of using an unregistered boat in coastal areas depends on specific circumstances such as the type of boat and its use. Florida law requires that all motorized boats, regardless of length, be registered. This includes boats used on public waters, which encompass the coastal areas around Miami. The registration process involves obtaining a Certificate of Registration and displaying a validation decal, which serves as proof that the boat is legally registered. However, non-motorized boats such as canoes, kayaks, and sailboats under 16 feet long used only for private recreation do not require registration.

**Trivia:** Miami is famous for its vibrant boating culture. The Miami International Boat Show, one of the largest boat shows in the world, draws thousands of boating enthusiasts annually, showcasing the latest in boat design and technology.
