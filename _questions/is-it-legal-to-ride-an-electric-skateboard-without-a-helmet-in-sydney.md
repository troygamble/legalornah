In Sydney, the legality of riding an electric skateboard without a helmet depends on various factors including the environment where it is used and specific local regulations. Generally, electric skateboards are categorized under the same rules as other personal mobility devices like electric scooters. In New South Wales, where Sydney is located, the law requires all riders of personal mobility devices to wear an approved helmet. This is enforced to ensure the safety of the rider, as head injuries are significantly reduced by wearing helmets. However, the enforcement of this law can vary by specific areas within Sydney and how strictly local authorities choose to implement it.

**Trivia:** Electric skateboards have gained popularity worldwide not just for recreation but also as a viable option for eco-friendly urban commuting. Interestingly, the world record for the longest journey on an electric skateboard was set by a trip of 2,252 kilometers (1,400 miles).
