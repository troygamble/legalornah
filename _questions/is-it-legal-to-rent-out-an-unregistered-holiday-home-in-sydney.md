In Sydney, the legality of renting out an unregistered holiday home depends on several factors including local zoning laws and specific regulations governing short-term rentals. New South Wales, which includes Sydney, has specific laws that require operators of short-term rental accommodations to register their properties with the state government. This registration is part of a broader framework that aims to ensure safety, compliance with local laws, and minimal disruption to communities. Failure to register can result in fines and other penalties. Additionally, local councils may have their own specific requirements or restrictions regarding holiday homes, which could include limitations on the number of days a property can be rented out or requirements for obtaining a planning permit.

**Trivia:** Sydney is known for its vibrant tourism industry, and the regulation of holiday homes is partly intended to balance the needs of tourists with those of local residents. Interestingly, the iconic Sydney Opera House was once projected to cost $7 million AUD and take four years to build, but it ended up costing $102 million and took 14 years to complete.
