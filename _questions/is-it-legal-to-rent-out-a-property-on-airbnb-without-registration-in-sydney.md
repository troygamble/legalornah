In Sydney, the legality of renting out a property on Airbnb without registration depends on several factors including the duration of the rental and the specific local government area (LGA). New South Wales (NSW) state government has set regulations that allow property owners to rent out their primary residence on Airbnb for up to 180 days per year without needing to register. However, if the property is not the owner's primary residence, or if it is rented out for more than 180 days per year, different rules may apply, including the requirement for registration or obtaining a development approval depending on the LGA's specific regulations. Additionally, some LGAs might have their own additional requirements or restrictions regarding short-term holiday letting.

**Trivia:** Airbnb was first launched in 2008 and was originally called 'AirBed & Breakfast', reflecting its founders' initial concept of renting out air beds in their apartment to guests.
