In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, operating a food truck requires adherence to specific health and safety regulations, which include mandatory health inspections. These regulations are enforced to ensure public safety and to maintain sanitary conditions in food service operations. The Food Sanitation Act of Japan mandates that any business involved in the sale and preparation of food must first obtain a food sanitation certificate, which is issued following a successful health inspection. This certificate confirms that the food truck meets the necessary hygiene standards prescribed by law.

**Trivia:** Food trucks in Tokyo often participate in seasonal or themed food festivals, showcasing a variety of local and international cuisines, making them a popular attraction among both locals and tourists.
