In Tokyo, as well as in other parts of Japan, the legality of fishing without a license primarily depends on the type of water body and the species being fished. Coastal fishing often does not require a license if it is for personal, non-commercial purposes. However, specific regulations can vary depending on local jurisdictions and the proximity to protected areas where stricter rules might apply. It is important to check with local authorities or the prefectural government for specific regulations in the area where you plan to fish. For example, fishing for certain species or using specific types of gear might require a permit or be subject to seasonal restrictions to protect local marine ecosystems.

**Trivia:** Tokyo Bay, a major body of water adjacent to the Tokyo metropolitan area, is a popular site for both recreational and commercial fishing. It is known for a wide variety of species including sea bass, flounder, and squid. Interestingly, Tokyo Bay has also been the site of various environmental preservation efforts to maintain its biodiversity.
