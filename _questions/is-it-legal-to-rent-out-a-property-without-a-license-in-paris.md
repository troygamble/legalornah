In Paris, whether you can rent out a property without a license primarily depends on the nature and duration of the rental. For short-term rentals, particularly of furnished tourist accommodations, a registration number is required from the city authorities. This is part of an effort to regulate vacation rentals that compete with the hotel industry and to prevent the depletion of long-term rental housing stock. Property owners must register with the town hall and display this registration number on all rental listings. For long-term rentals, such licensing is generally not required, but landlords must comply with various housing standards and regulations.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced stricter regulations on short-term rentals after finding that many properties were being rented out for most of the year, which contravened existing laws intended for short stays. This was part of a broader effort to preserve local housing stock for residents.
