In Sydney, as well as throughout New South Wales and the rest of Australia, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without at least a Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance, which is also known as 'Green Slip' insurance in NSW. This type of insurance is mandatory and covers the driver's liability for injuries caused to others in a road accident. Driving without CTP insurance is a serious offence and can result in hefty fines, demerit points, and even the suspension of the driver's license. Furthermore, if involved in an accident without insurance, the driver may be held personally liable for any injuries or damages caused.

**Trivia:** In New South Wales, the term 'Green Slip' comes from the green form that drivers must fill out when purchasing this compulsory insurance. Interestingly, NSW is unique in Australia for referring to its compulsory third-party insurance by this color-based nickname.
