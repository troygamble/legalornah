In Paris, particularly in historic districts, the legality of renting out a home without a permit largely depends on the duration and type of rental. For short-term rentals (less than a year, typically for vacation rentals), a permit or registration with the city hall is generally required. This regulation is enforced to manage the impact of short-term rentals on local housing markets and preserve residential spaces. Property owners must register their property and obtain a registration number, which must be displayed in all rental advertisements. For long-term rentals, the requirements are less stringent, but compliance with local housing codes and regulations is mandatory.

**Trivia:** Paris' historic districts are protected under stringent urban regulations, which include not only rental laws but also architectural and aesthetic standards to preserve their historical integrity.
