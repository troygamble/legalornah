In Sydney, Australia, the legality of renting out a room without a permit largely depends on the specific circumstances and local regulations. Generally, if the property is your primary residence and you are renting out a room while you continue to live there, you may not need a specific permit. However, local council regulations can vary, and some areas might require you to register or obtain approval for such arrangements, especially if significant modifications are made to accommodate tenants or if the rental is intended as a short-term, vacation-style letting. For properties not classified as the owner's primary residence, or for more commercialized rental operations, different rules and possibly a permit might be required, particularly under local council zoning laws or residential tenancy regulations.

**Trivia:** Sydney's real estate market is one of the most expensive in the world. The city's unique geography and high demand for property have contributed to high rental and property prices, making room rentals a popular option for many residents to help manage living costs.
