In Manhattan, as well as throughout the state of New York, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without having active auto insurance. New York State law requires all motor vehicles to be covered by a minimum level of liability insurance. This insurance must be maintained at all times by the vehicle's registered owner. The minimum coverage requirements include $25,000 for bodily injury to one person, $50,000 for bodily injury per accident, and $10,000 for property damage in any one accident. Failure to have this insurance can result in severe penalties, including fines, vehicle impoundment, and the suspension of driving privileges.

**Trivia:** New York was one of the first states in the U.S. to require automobile liability insurance. This law was enacted in 1956 as part of efforts to provide financial protection to individuals involved in traffic accidents.
