In New York City, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a health inspection certificate. All mobile food vendors, including food trucks, are required to pass a health inspection to ensure that they meet the New York City Health Code and State Sanitary Code. The health inspection assesses various aspects of the food truck, including food handling, temperature control, and general cleanliness, to protect public health. Vendors must display their health inspection certificate prominently within the food truck. Failure to possess or display a valid health inspection certificate can result in fines, and the food truck may be prohibited from operating.

**Trivia:** New York City is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering a wide range of cuisines from around the world. This vibrant street food culture is part of what makes NYC a unique culinary destination.
