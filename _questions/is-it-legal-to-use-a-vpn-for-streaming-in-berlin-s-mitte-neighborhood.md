In Berlin's Mitte neighborhood, as in the rest of Germany, the legality of using a VPN for streaming largely depends on the purpose and the content accessed. German law does not prohibit the use of VPNs per se; they are commonly used for enhancing online privacy and security. However, using a VPN to access geo-restricted content or services that explicitly forbid such access in their terms of service can lead to potential legal issues or violation of these terms. For instance, streaming platforms like Netflix have specific licensing agreements for different regions, and circumventing these agreements using a VPN might violate their terms of service, although it is typically not pursued as a legal violation by authorities.

**Trivia:** Germany is known for its strict privacy laws and was one of the first countries to adopt data protection legislation with the enactment of its federal Data Protection Act in 1977.
