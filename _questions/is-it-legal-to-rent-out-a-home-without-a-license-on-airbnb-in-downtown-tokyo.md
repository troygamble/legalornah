In Tokyo, the legality of renting out a home on Airbnb without a license depends on several factors, including the duration of the rental and local regulations. Under Japan's national Minpaku Law, which was enacted in 2018, private residences can be rented out to guests for short-term stays, but the homeowners must register with the local government and obtain a license. This law was introduced to regulate the booming market of short-term rentals and address concerns related to safety, noise, and the impact on residential communities. Rentals are typically limited to 180 days per year unless specific local rules or exceptions apply. In some areas, including parts of downtown Tokyo, additional regulations may be imposed by local wards or building management, which could further restrict or allow such rentals.

**Trivia:** Since the implementation of the Minpaku Law, Tokyo has seen a significant increase in legally registered short-term rental properties. This law was in part influenced by the upcoming international events such as the Olympics, aiming to accommodate a surge in tourists while maintaining local living standards.
