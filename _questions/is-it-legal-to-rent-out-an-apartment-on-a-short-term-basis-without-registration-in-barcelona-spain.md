In Barcelona, Spain, it is illegal to rent out an apartment on a short-term basis without proper registration. The city has implemented strict regulations to manage the influx of tourists and protect the local housing market. Property owners who wish to engage in short-term rentals must obtain a license from the local government. This process involves ensuring that the property meets specific safety and quality standards. Additionally, the number of licenses issued is capped to prevent an oversaturation of short-term rentals, which can drive up local rents and displace long-term residents.

**Trivia:** Barcelona introduced these stringent measures after noticing significant impacts on the local housing market and the daily lives of residents due to the rise in popularity of platforms like Airbnb. The city's approach has become a model for other popular tourist destinations seeking to balance the benefits and drawbacks of short-term rentals.
