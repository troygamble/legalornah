In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. Japanese law is very strict about the possession and carrying of weapons, including firearms and knives. The Firearms and Swords Control Law strictly regulates the possession, use, and transport of firearms and blades longer than 15 cm. Individuals must obtain a specific license to own a firearm, which involves rigorous background checks, mental health evaluations, and firearm safety courses. Even with a license, carrying a concealed weapon in public is generally prohibited.

**Trivia:** Japan has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world, often attributed to its stringent gun control laws. In most years, the number of gun-related crimes nationwide can be counted on one hand.
