In Toronto, as in all of Ontario, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without car insurance. The law requires all motor vehicles to be insured under a motor vehicle liability policy. Under the Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act of Ontario, every vehicle owner must have at least a standard insurance policy, which includes third-party liability, accident benefits, and uninsured automobile coverage. Driving without insurance can result in severe penalties including fines ranging from $5,000 to $50,000, the possibility of having your driver's license suspended, and your vehicle impounded.

**Trivia:** Ontario has one of the highest car insurance rates in Canada, partly due to the high density of vehicles and the greater likelihood of theft and accidents, especially in urban areas like downtown Toronto.
