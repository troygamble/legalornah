In Paris, it is illegal to rent out an apartment on Airbnb without proper registration. The city regulations require that any short-term rental property, such as those listed on Airbnb, must be registered with the city authorities. This regulation is part of an effort to regulate the short-term rental market, which has been blamed for contributing to housing shortages and increasing rental prices. The registration process involves obtaining a registration number, which must be displayed on all rental listings. Failure to comply with this regulation can result in hefty fines for the property owners.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most popular Airbnb destinations globally, with thousands of listings available across the city. This popularity has led to strict regulations to balance tourism benefits with the needs of local residents.
