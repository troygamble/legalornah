In Barcelona, it is illegal to rent out a home on platforms like Airbnb without a proper tourist license. The city has implemented strict regulations to control the rental of tourist accommodations, primarily to address issues related to over-tourism and the preservation of residential housing stock. Property owners must obtain a license from the local government, which ensures that the rental property complies with specific safety, quality, and location standards set by the city. The enforcement of these regulations is strict, and failure to comply can result in hefty fines for the property owners.

**Trivia:** Barcelona's regulation of Airbnb and similar platforms became particularly stringent after noticing a significant impact on local housing markets and neighborhoods. This includes the transformation of residential areas into tourist zones, leading to increased rents and the displacement of long-term residents.
