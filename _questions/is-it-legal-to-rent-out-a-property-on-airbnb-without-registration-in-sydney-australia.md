In Sydney, Australia, the legal status of renting out a property on Airbnb without registration depends on several factors including the local council regulations and the specific zoning laws of the area. Generally, property owners are required to comply with the New South Wales (NSW) Government's short-term rental accommodation framework. This framework includes a mandatory registration process for anyone wanting to rent out their property on short-term rental platforms like Airbnb. Hosts must register their property with the NSW Planning Portal and obtain a unique identification number which must be displayed on all online listings and advertisements.

**Trivia:** Sydney was one of the first cities in Australia to regulate Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms, responding to concerns about housing affordability and the impact of these rentals on local communities.
