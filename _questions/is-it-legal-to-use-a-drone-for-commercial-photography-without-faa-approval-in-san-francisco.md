In the United States, the use of drones for commercial purposes, including commercial photography, is regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). According to the FAA regulations, any commercial drone operation requires the operator to obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate under Part 107 of the FAA rules. This includes passing an aeronautical knowledge test. Additionally, drone operations in San Francisco must adhere to specific local laws and airspace restrictions, which can include limitations on flying in certain areas due to privacy concerns, safety, and security, especially near landmarks and airports.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first FAA-approved drone delivery in the United States happened in July 2015, when medical supplies were delivered to a rural health clinic in Virginia?
