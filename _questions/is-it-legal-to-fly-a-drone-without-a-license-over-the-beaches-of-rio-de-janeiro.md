In Brazil, the legality of flying a drone without a license over the beaches of Rio de Janeiro depends on several factors including the drone's weight and the purpose of its use. The National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) regulates drone usage and requires drones weighing over 250 grams to be registered. Additionally, for commercial use or drones weighing over 25 kilograms, a license is mandatory. For recreational purposes, drones under 25 kilograms do not require a license but must comply with ANAC's safety guidelines, such as maintaining a certain distance from crowds and not interfering with manned aircraft operations.

**Trivia:** Rio de Janeiro is known for its beautiful beaches like Copacabana and Ipanema, which are popular spots for drone photography due to their scenic views and vibrant atmosphere.
