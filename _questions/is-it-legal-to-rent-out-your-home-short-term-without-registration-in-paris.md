In Paris, it is illegal to rent out your home on a short-term basis without proper registration. The city requires homeowners who wish to rent their properties for short stays (defined as rentals for less than a year for residents and less than 90 days for non-residents) to register with the local authorities. This regulation aims to control the number of properties available for short-term rental, which can impact the availability of long-term housing for residents. Once registered, the homeowner receives a registration number that must be displayed in all rental advertisements. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in substantial fines.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stringent measures in response to the housing market pressures and the impact of global platforms like Airbnb on local communities. The city has taken legal actions against non-compliant rental listings, reflecting its commitment to preserving residential spaces for local inhabitants.
