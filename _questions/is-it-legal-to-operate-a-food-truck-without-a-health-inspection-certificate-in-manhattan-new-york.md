In Manhattan, New York, it is illegal to operate a food truck without obtaining a health inspection certificate. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene requires that all mobile food vendors, including food trucks, pass a health inspection to ensure they meet the city's food safety regulations. This certificate, often referred to as a 'mobile food vending license,' is mandatory and confirms that the food truck has been inspected and is compliant with health standards designed to protect the public from foodborne illnesses and unsanitary food handling practices.

**Trivia:** New York City is famous for its diverse food truck scene, offering everything from gourmet meals and ethnic foods to classic street snacks. The city's first food truck was reportedly an ice cream truck in the mid-19th century.
