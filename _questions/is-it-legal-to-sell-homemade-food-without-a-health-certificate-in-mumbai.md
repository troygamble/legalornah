In Mumbai, the sale of homemade food without a health certificate largely depends on the scale of the operation and the type of food being sold. For small-scale operations, such as occasional selling or home-based catering for limited numbers of people, there may not be stringent requirements for a health certificate. However, for regular commercial activities, Mumbai's regulations, aligned with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), mandate obtaining a food safety registration or license. This ensures that the food is safe for consumption and meets certain health standards. The FSSAI license or registration depends on the scale of the business and the nature of its operations, with more comprehensive requirements for larger operations.

**Trivia:** Mumbai is known for its vibrant street food culture. Interestingly, even street food vendors are required to adhere to certain health and safety standards and can be seen displaying their FSSAI license number on their carts, making it a unique blend of informal yet regulated food business environment.
