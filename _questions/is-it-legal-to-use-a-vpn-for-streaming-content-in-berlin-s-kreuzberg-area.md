The legality of using a VPN for streaming content in Berlin's Kreuzberg area primarily depends on the purpose and the nature of the content being accessed. Generally, using a VPN in Germany is legal, including in Kreuzberg. VPNs are commonly used for enhancing security and privacy online. However, issues arise when VPNs are used to circumvent geo-restrictions imposed by content providers. Many streaming services, such as Netflix, Hulu, and others, have terms of service that explicitly prohibit the use of technology, including VPNs, to access their content from regions where they do not have rights to distribute it. Violating these terms can lead to the suspension or termination of your streaming service account.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the use of VPNs surged globally after the NSA surveillance revelations by Edward Snowden in 2013? Many internet users started using VPNs as a tool to safeguard their privacy online.
