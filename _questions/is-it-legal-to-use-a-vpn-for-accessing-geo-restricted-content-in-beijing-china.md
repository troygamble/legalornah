In China, the use of VPNs to bypass internet censorship, such as accessing geo-restricted content, is generally illegal for individuals without government authorization. The Chinese government employs a robust internet regulation system known as the Great Firewall, which blocks access to many foreign websites and monitors and restricts internet traffic to maintain control over the digital space. Unauthorized VPN services are often targeted by government crackdowns. Only government-approved VPNs, which typically do not allow access to banned websites, are legal. Using an unauthorized VPN to access geo-restricted content can lead to penalties, including fines and disruption of internet service.

**Trivia:** China's Great Firewall is one of the most sophisticated censorship systems in the world. It employs a variety of methods to filter and block traffic, including IP blocking, DNS tampering, and deep packet inspection, making it a significant barrier to free access to information.
