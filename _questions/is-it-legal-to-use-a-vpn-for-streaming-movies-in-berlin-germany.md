In Berlin, Germany, the legality of using a VPN to stream movies largely depends on the content being accessed and the terms of service of the streaming platform. German law does not prohibit the use of VPNs per se; they are commonly used for enhancing privacy and security online. However, using a VPN to access geo-restricted content might violate the terms of service of certain streaming services, which could potentially lead to the suspension or termination of your account with those services. Furthermore, it is crucial to ensure that the content accessed through a VPN is not pirated or otherwise illegal to distribute or watch, as this could result in severe legal penalties under German copyright laws.

**Trivia:** Germany is known for having some of the strictest privacy laws in the world, often leading the way in data protection regulations within the European Union.
