In downtown Toronto, as in the rest of Ontario and Canada, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without having valid auto insurance. The law requires that all motor vehicles must have a minimum level of insurance coverage before they can be legally operated on public roads. This mandatory insurance includes third-party liability coverage, which protects the driver against costs that may arise from injuries to others and damage to their property. Driving without insurance is considered a serious offense and can result in hefty fines, the suspension of one's driver's license, and the impounding of the vehicle.

**Trivia:** Interestingly, Ontario has some of the highest auto insurance rates in Canada, largely due to the high number of claims and the cost of those claims in the province. This makes driving without insurance not only illegal but also a financially risky decision.
