In New York City, the legality of performing street music without a license depends on the specific location and manner in which the performance is conducted. Generally, street performers, also known as buskers, do not need a license to perform in public spaces unless they are using amplification devices or performing in certain parks which require a special permit. For instance, performing in subway stations under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) requires an audition and a permit through the Music Under New York (MUNY) program. However, street performers must adhere to local ordinances regarding noise levels and public obstruction, and they should not block pedestrian traffic or create safety hazards.

**Trivia:** New York City's subway system is famous for its wide range of street performers. Every year, hundreds of performers audition for the Music Under New York program, which schedules performances at 30 locations throughout the subway system.
