In Texas, it is legal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit as long as you meet certain criteria. The state allows for permitless carry, often referred to as 'constitutional carry,' which was enacted into law under House Bill 1927, effective September 1, 2021. This law permits individuals who are 21 years of age or older and not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing a firearm to carry handguns in a concealed or open manner without the need for a license. However, there are restrictions; for instance, individuals must not have felony convictions, certain misdemeanor convictions, or be under certain protective or restraining orders.

**Trivia:** Texas was the 21st state to adopt a permitless carry law, reflecting a broader movement in the United States towards what proponents refer to as 'constitutional carry' laws.
