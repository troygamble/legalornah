In Tokyo, the legality of renting out a home on Airbnb without a specific license depends on several regulations. According to Japan's Minpaku Law, which came into effect in June 2018, private residences can be rented out to guests, but the homeowner must register with the local government and obtain a license if they intend to rent out their property for short-term stays (fewer than 180 days per year). This law was implemented to regulate the burgeoning number of homes being listed on platforms like Airbnb, ensuring safety and compliance with local laws. Homeowners must also adhere to local rules which can include restrictions on the number of days a property can be rented out and requirements to report guest information to local authorities.

**Trivia:** Tokyo's implementation of the Minpaku Law was partly in anticipation of the increased demand for accommodation due to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, aiming to boost tourism infrastructure while maintaining residential harmony.
