In Victoria, Australia, it is generally legal for individuals and property owners to collect rainwater. The collection of rainwater is encouraged as a sustainable practice to conserve water resources, particularly in areas prone to drought. Homeowners often use rainwater tanks to gather and store rainwater for non-potable uses such as garden irrigation, toilet flushing, and laundry. However, there are certain regulations and guidelines that must be followed to ensure that rainwater collection systems do not contaminate the water supply or cause harm to public health. These regulations may involve the proper installation and maintenance of rainwater tanks, including appropriate filtration and disinfection systems if the water is to be used for drinking.

**Trivia:** Rainwater harvesting can significantly reduce dependence on municipal water supplies and can also help in reducing stormwater runoff, which can lead to erosion and pollution in natural water bodies.
