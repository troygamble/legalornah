Flying drones in London parks is subject to specific regulations and can vary depending on the park. Generally, drone operators must comply with the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) regulations, which require operators to keep drones within line of sight, avoid flying near people or buildings, and not exceed 120 meters in altitude. Additionally, many parks in London are managed by different boroughs or entities like the Royal Parks, and each may have its own rules regarding drone usage. For instance, the Royal Parks explicitly prohibit flying drones in the parks they manage without prior permission.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first recorded use of a drone for warfare dates back to 1849, when Austria attacked Venice with unmanned balloons loaded with explosives?
