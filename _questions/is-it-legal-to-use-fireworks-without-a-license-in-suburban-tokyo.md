In suburban Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the use of fireworks is regulated by both national and local laws. Generally, small handheld fireworks known as 'senko hanabi' are allowed without special permissions. These are considered safe for individual use in residential areas. However, larger fireworks displays, which include aerial fireworks that are shot into the sky, require a permit. This is because they pose greater risks of fire and injury. The permits are typically issued by local authorities, and applicants must demonstrate that they will follow safety guidelines and have measures in place to control crowds and manage emergencies.

**Trivia:** Fireworks have a long history in Japan, dating back to the 17th century. They were originally used to ward off evil spirits. Today, fireworks are a staple during summer festivals in Japan, with many large-scale fireworks competitions held throughout the country, attracting thousands of spectators.
