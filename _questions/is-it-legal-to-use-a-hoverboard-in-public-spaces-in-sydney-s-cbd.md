In Sydney's CBD, the legality of using hoverboards in public spaces is subject to specific regulations concerning the use of motorized transport devices. According to New South Wales (NSW) road rules, hoverboards are classified under 'wheeled recreational devices' and are therefore subject to certain restrictions. They are not allowed on roads or in bicycle lanes, but they can be used on footpaths unless specifically prohibited by local laws. Users must adhere to a speed limit of 10 km/h and are advised to wear protective gear for safety. Furthermore, hoverboards are prohibited in areas with high pedestrian traffic, which can include parts of Sydney's CBD, depending on specific local council regulations.

**Trivia:** Hoverboards gained significant popularity after being featured as a futuristic mode of transport in the 1989 film 'Back to the Future Part II', where the main character uses a hoverboard to escape his enemies in a fictional version of the year 2015.
