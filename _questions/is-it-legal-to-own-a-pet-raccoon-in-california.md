In California, it is illegal to own a pet raccoon without a specific permit. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulates the possession of wild animals and considers raccoons as potentially dangerous wildlife. This classification means that raccoons cannot be legally kept as pets by the general public. Permits to own a raccoon are rarely issued and are generally reserved for educational institutions, research facilities, or wildlife rehabilitation centers that meet stringent requirements for the care and containment of such animals.

**Trivia:** Raccoons are highly adaptable creatures that have been known to open locks, remember solutions to tasks for up to three years, and even turn on taps. Their dexterity and intelligence make them fascinating creatures but also challenging and potentially problematic pets.
