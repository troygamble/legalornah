In Paris, the legality of renting out a home on Airbnb without a permit depends on several factors, including the duration and frequency of the rental. According to Parisian regulations, if you are renting out your primary residence, you are allowed to do so for up to 120 days per year without a special permit. However, this is only permissible if the property is your main residence, meaning you live there for at least 8 months a year, unless you are absent due to professional reasons, health issues, or social obligations. On the other hand, if the property is not your primary residence, or if you intend to rent it out for more than 120 days per year, you must register the property with the city and obtain a commercial use permit. This is part of the city's efforts to regulate short-term rentals and ensure that the housing market is not adversely affected by the proliferation of vacation rentals.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top tourist destinations in the world, and it has one of the highest densities of Airbnb listings. The city's efforts to regulate Airbnb rentals stem from concerns about housing shortages and the preservation of residential areas for local inhabitants.
