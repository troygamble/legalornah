The legality of using a VPN for streaming Netflix in Berlin hinges on several factors, primarily the terms of service of Netflix and the purpose of VPN usage. Netflix's terms of service generally prohibit the use of technology or software to access content not intended for a user's region. Although using a VPN to access Netflix is not illegal under German law, it can be considered a breach of contract with Netflix. This means that while you are not breaking the law, you are violating Netflix's terms, which could lead to your account being restricted or terminated.

**Trivia:** Netflix began blocking VPNs aggressively in 2016 after pressure from content producers who wanted to enforce regional content licensing agreements. This was a significant shift from the earlier, more permissive stance towards VPN use.
