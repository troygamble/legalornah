In central Paris, it is generally required to have a permit to rent out a home for short-term stays, particularly for durations less than 120 days per year. This regulation is primarily aimed at controlling the short-term rental market, often associated with platforms like Airbnb, to ensure that the housing market remains stable and that residential properties are not converted into de facto hotels. Homeowners must register with the city authorities and obtain a registration number, which must be displayed in all rental advertisements. For long-term rentals, different regulations apply, and typically, such permits may not be necessary, but compliance with local housing standards and laws is mandatory.

**Trivia:** Paris has been particularly stringent with regulations on short-term rentals due to concerns over housing availability and the preservation of community life in its central districts. In fact, Parisian authorities have been known to conduct checks and impose hefty fines on those who violate short-term rental regulations.
