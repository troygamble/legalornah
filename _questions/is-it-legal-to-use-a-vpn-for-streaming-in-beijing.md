The legality of using a VPN for streaming in Beijing is not straightforward and depends on the circumstances and the specific use of the VPN. In China, the government regulates the use of the internet very tightly, including the use of VPNs. The use of VPNs is allowed but heavily regulated. Only government-approved VPNs are legal, and these are generally not available to the general public. Using an unauthorized VPN to access blocked content, such as certain streaming services, can be considered illegal. This includes bypassing the Great Firewall of China, which blocks access to many foreign websites and services.

**Trivia:** China's Great Firewall is one of the most sophisticated censorship systems in the world. It uses a combination of methods to block access to various internet services and websites, including IP blocking, DNS filtering, and URL filtering.
