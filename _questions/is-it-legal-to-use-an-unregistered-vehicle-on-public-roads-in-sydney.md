In Sydney, as well as throughout Australia, it is illegal to drive an unregistered vehicle on public roads. The law requires that all motor vehicles must be registered with the relevant state or territory road authority to be legally driven on public roads. This registration helps ensure that vehicles meet minimum safety standards and that vehicle owners are accountable for their vehicles. Additionally, driving an unregistered vehicle can result in significant penalties including fines and demerit points on the driver's license. Police and other enforcement officers routinely check for vehicle registration during traffic stops or through the use of automatic number plate recognition systems.

**Trivia:** Did you know? In Australia, the cost and process of registering a vehicle can vary significantly between different states and territories, reflecting differences in insurance requirements and road maintenance funding.
