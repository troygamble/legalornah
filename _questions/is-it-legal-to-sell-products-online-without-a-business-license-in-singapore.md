In Singapore, whether you need a business license to sell products online depends on the type of products or services you intend to sell. For general products and services, there is no specific requirement for a business license just to operate online. However, certain types of goods and services are regulated, and selling these may require specific licenses or permits. For example, if you are selling food products, health products, or offering certain types of services such as financial advisory or private education, you must obtain the relevant licenses from the appropriate government bodies. Additionally, all businesses, including online ones, must be registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) if they are conducted on a continual basis for profit, which is a separate requirement from having a business license.

**Trivia:** Singapore is renowned for its strong regulatory framework, which is one of the reasons it is often ranked as one of the easiest places in the world to do business. This ease of doing business extends to the digital economy, where the government actively supports e-commerce initiatives.
