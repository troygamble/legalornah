In Sydney's CBD, the legality of renting out a home on Airbnb without a specific license depends on several factors, including the type of property, the zoning laws, and the duration of the rental. New South Wales (NSW) government regulations allow homeowners to rent out their homes as short-term holiday accommodation, but there are restrictions. For instance, if the property is in the Greater Sydney area, there is a 180-day cap per year for properties where the host does not live on-site. Properties must also comply with fire safety and planning requirements, and in some cases, local council approvals may be necessary depending on the specific location and zoning rules.

**Trivia:** Airbnb was first launched in 2008 and has since become a global phenomenon, offering more than 7 million accommodations in over 100,000 cities worldwide. Sydney, known for its iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge, is one of the top destinations for Airbnb users.
