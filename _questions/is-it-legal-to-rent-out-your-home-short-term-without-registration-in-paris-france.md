In Paris, France, the legality of renting out your home for short-term stays without registration is contingent upon several conditions. Homeowners are allowed to rent out their primary residence (the home where they live most of the year) on short-term rental platforms such as Airbnb for up to 120 days per year without needing to register the property as a commercial enterprise. However, if the property is not the homeowner's primary residence, or if they wish to rent it out for more than 120 days per year, they must register the property with the city authorities. This regulation is part of an effort to prevent a shortage of long-term rental properties, which can be exacerbated by the conversion of residential units into vacation rentals.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most active markets for Airbnb, with thousands of listings across the city. This popularity has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and the implementation of specific laws to manage the impact of short-term rentals on the local housing market and community.
