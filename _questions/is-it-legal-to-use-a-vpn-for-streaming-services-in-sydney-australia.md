In Sydney, Australia, the legality of using a VPN for streaming services largely depends on the purpose and manner in which the VPN is used. Generally, using a VPN in itself is not illegal in Australia. Australians often use VPNs for enhancing online privacy and security. However, issues arise when VPNs are used to access geo-restricted content. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and others often have terms of service that restrict the use of technologies like VPNs to bypass geo-restrictions. Violating these terms can lead to termination of the service agreement, though it typically does not involve legal prosecution.

**Trivia:** Australia passed its Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act in 2015, which increased the surveillance capabilities of national security agencies and led to a significant rise in the use of VPNs among Australian internet users seeking to protect their privacy.
