In Japan, the legality of flying a drone without registration primarily depends on the drone's weight and the specific area where the drone is flown. Drones weighing 200 grams or more must be registered with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) before they can be operated. Additionally, flying drones in densely populated areas, such as downtown Tokyo, is generally restricted unless specific permissions are obtained. This includes areas near airports, over crowds, and around important infrastructure. The regulations are part of Japan's efforts to ensure safety and privacy, and violations can lead to penalties.

**Trivia:** In Tokyo, there are designated areas known as 'drone parks' where enthusiasts can legally fly their drones without the usual restrictions found in urban areas. These parks are part of a government initiative to safely integrate drones into recreational and commercial activities.
