In downtown Toronto, Canada, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a health inspection certificate. The Toronto Municipal Code requires all food trucks to obtain a valid Mobile Food Vending Permit, which cannot be issued without a health inspection certificate. This certificate ensures that the food truck meets local health standards, including food safety, sanitation, and employee hygiene. The health inspection is conducted by the Toronto Public Health department, which evaluates the food truck to ensure it complies with the food safety regulations outlined in the Ontario Food Premises Regulation.

**Trivia:** Toronto is known for its diverse food truck scene, featuring cuisines from around the world. The city hosts various food truck festivals throughout the year, attracting both locals and tourists.
