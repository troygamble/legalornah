In New York City, the legality of renting out a residential property without a license depends on the type of rental and the duration. For long-term rentals, generally no specific license is required from the city to rent out a property as a standard residential lease. However, there are exceptions, such as when the property is a multi-family dwelling, which might require certain permits or adherence to specific building codes and safety regulations. On the other hand, short-term rentals (less than 30 days) are subject to stricter regulations. According to New York State's Multiple Dwelling Law, short-term rentals are largely illegal in buildings with three or more units, unless the permanent resident is present during the rental period. This is often enforced to prevent apartments from being used as hotels, which can disrupt local housing markets and community stability.

**Trivia:** New York City's unique and stringent regulations on short-term rentals were largely a response to the rise of online platforms like Airbnb, which saw a significant number of apartments being converted into unofficial, unregulated hotel rooms, impacting the availability and affordability of housing for permanent residents.
