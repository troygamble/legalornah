In Tokyo, Japan, as in the rest of the country, it is illegal to drive an unregistered vehicle on public roads. Japanese law requires all motor vehicles to be registered with the local government where the vehicle is housed. This process involves receiving a vehicle inspection certificate known as 'Shaken', which is a rigorous vehicle safety inspection, emissions test, and proof of compulsory automobile liability insurance. The 'Shaken' must be renewed periodically, typically every two to three years, depending on the vehicle type and age. Driving an unregistered vehicle not only bypasses these critical safety and environmental checks but also violates traffic laws, potentially resulting in fines, penalties, or even criminal charges.

**Trivia:** The 'Shaken' system in Japan is known for being particularly stringent, contributing to the high standard of vehicle maintenance and safety in the country. Interestingly, this system is also one of the reasons why many Japanese cars are exported overseas once they become costly to maintain under these strict regulations.
