In Cape Town, South Africa, the legality of fishing without a license in coastal areas depends on the specific type of fishing activity and the location. Generally, recreational fishing in the sea does not require a license, but there are exceptions, particularly for certain species or protected areas. The Marine Living Resources Act regulates fishing activities, and specific regulations under this act may require individuals to obtain permits for activities such as collecting bait, spearfishing, or harvesting marine organisms in intertidal zones. It is essential to check the latest regulations or contact local authorities for the most accurate information. Commercial fishing, however, always requires a license, and there are strict penalties for non-compliance.

**Trivia:** Cape Town's coastal waters are home to the famous Two Oceans Aquarium, which showcases the incredible biodiversity of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This area is a hotspot for marine life and attracts fishing enthusiasts from around the world.
