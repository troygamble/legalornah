In central Paris, it is legal to rent out your apartment on Airbnb, but there are strict regulations that must be followed. Homeowners can rent out their primary residence on short-term rental platforms like Airbnb for up to 120 days per year. This regulation is intended to prevent long-term rental shortages, which can occur when properties are used extensively for short-term tourism rather than long-term residential purposes. Additionally, the homeowner must register with the city and obtain a registration number that must be clearly displayed on the listing. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world, and in response to the rise of short-term rental platforms, the city has implemented a tourist tax that Airbnb collects from guests on behalf of hosts. This tax is used in part to help maintain the cultural and historical infrastructure of the city.
