In Paris, France, the legality of renting out a residential property without a license depends on the nature and duration of the rental. For short-term rentals (less than 120 days per year), property owners must register the property with the city hall and obtain a registration number. This is particularly enforced for rentals offered through platforms like Airbnb. The city has implemented these regulations to manage the number of tourist accommodations available, aiming to maintain housing availability for residents. For long-term rentals, a license is not typically required, but landlords must comply with French rental laws, which include ensuring the property meets safety and health standards.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stringent regulations on short-term rentals in response to the housing shortage and to preserve the character of residential neighborhoods, amidst rising concerns that platforms like Airbnb were transforming residential units into de facto hotels.
