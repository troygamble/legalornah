In Beijing, China, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to bypass geo-restrictions and access content that is otherwise unavailable is generally considered illegal. The Chinese government maintains strict control over the internet under policies commonly referred to as the 'Great Firewall of China'. The use of unauthorized VPNs to circumvent these controls is prohibited. The government has the authority to block VPN services that have not received official approval and to penalize individuals or organizations that use such VPNs for accessing blocked content, including foreign websites and services.

**Trivia:** China's Great Firewall is one of the most sophisticated censorship systems in the world. It not only blocks website content but also monitors individuals' internet activities. Interestingly, during major political events, the restrictions are often intensified to prevent the spread of dissenting views.
