In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, flying a drone in densely populated areas such as downtown Tokyo is generally prohibited without prior permission from the relevant authorities. The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) has established specific rules governing the use of drones. These rules prohibit flying drones over residential areas or areas surrounding an airport without obtaining permission. Additionally, drones must not be flown at night or beyond the visual line of sight of the operator unless special permission has been granted. While the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) regulates drone use in the United States, in Japan, it is the MLIT that sets the regulations. Therefore, FAA registration does not apply in Japan, but local registration and adherence to Japanese regulations are mandatory.

**Trivia:** Japan's interest in drone technology is not just regulatory. The country has been a pioneer in technological innovations, and its use of drones extends to various fields including agriculture, where drones are used for crop monitoring and spraying, showing a unique integration of technology in traditional sectors.
