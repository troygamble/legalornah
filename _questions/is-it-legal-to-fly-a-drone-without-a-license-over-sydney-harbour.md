Flying a drone over Sydney Harbour is subject to specific regulations primarily governed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) of Australia. CASA mandates that drone operators must adhere to certain safety rules, which include not flying over populous areas where your drone might pose a risk to people or property. Sydney Harbour, being a highly populous and sensitive area, often requires additional permissions, especially if the drone is being used for commercial purposes or weighs over 2kg. For recreational purposes, drones weighing less than 2kg can generally be flown without a license but must still comply with standard safety rules, such as keeping the drone within visual line-of-sight and not flying it above people.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is not only famous for its stunning views but also for its strict airspace regulations due to the presence of Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge, which are iconic and highly protected sites.
