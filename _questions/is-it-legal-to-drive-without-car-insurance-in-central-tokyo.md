In Japan, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without insurance. The law requires all motorists to have at least compulsory automobile liability insurance, known as 'jibaiseki hoken'. This insurance covers the costs associated with injury or death to other parties in the event of an accident, but it does not cover damage to the driver's own vehicle or other property damage. For comprehensive coverage, drivers are advised to purchase voluntary insurance, which covers vehicle damage and property damage. Driving without the mandatory insurance can result in severe penalties, including fines and suspension of the driver's license.

**Trivia:** Japan was the first country in Asia to implement compulsory automobile liability insurance. This system was established to ensure that victims of road traffic accidents could receive compensation, which reflects the country's high priority on public safety and responsibility.
