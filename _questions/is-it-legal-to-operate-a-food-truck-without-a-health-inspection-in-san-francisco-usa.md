In San Francisco, it is illegal to operate a food truck without undergoing a health inspection. The Department of Public Health requires all food trucks to acquire a Mobile Food Facility Permit, which can only be issued after a thorough health inspection. This inspection ensures that the food truck meets all the necessary health and safety standards, including proper food handling, storage, and preparation practices. The health inspection also checks for adequate sanitation and waste disposal systems, ensuring the food truck operates in a manner that protects public health.

**Trivia:** San Francisco is known for its vibrant food truck culture, with events like 'Off the Grid' showcasing a variety of food trucks, which serve everything from gourmet meals to ethnic specialties, making it a popular destination for food enthusiasts.
