In Mumbai, including the Bandra area, it is illegal to operate a food truck without obtaining a health certificate. This requirement is mandated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. The act requires all food business operators, including mobile units like food trucks, to secure a FSSAI license or registration depending on the nature and scale of their operation. The health certificate ensures that the food truck meets certain hygiene and safety standards, which are critical for protecting public health. Furthermore, local municipal corporations such as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) may have additional health and safety regulations that need to be complied with to operate legally in specific localities.

**Trivia:** Mumbai's street food culture is renowned globally, and food trucks have become a trendy addition, offering everything from local favorites to international cuisines. The city's first food truck festival was held in 2017, showcasing a diverse range of culinary delights on wheels.
