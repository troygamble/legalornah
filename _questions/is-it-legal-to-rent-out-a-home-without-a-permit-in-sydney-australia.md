In Sydney, Australia, the legality of renting out a home without a permit largely depends on the type of rental and the local council regulations. For long-term residential rentals, typically, a specific permit may not be required. However, property owners must ensure that the property meets all building codes, safety standards, and is registered appropriately if required by local laws. On the other hand, short-term rentals, such as those facilitated through platforms like Airbnb, may have different requirements. For example, New South Wales (NSW) has specific regulations that limit the number of days a property can be rented out on a short-term basis without needing a permit to 180 days per year in the Greater Sydney area. Additionally, strata committees might have their own rules that could restrict or forbid short-term letting.

**Trivia:** Sydney, known for its robust real estate market, has experienced significant changes in rental laws, especially with the rise of short-term rental platforms. In response to the increasing popularity of these platforms, NSW introduced specific laws in 2018 to regulate short-term holiday letting, reflecting the city's adaptability to new forms of accommodation driven by technology.
