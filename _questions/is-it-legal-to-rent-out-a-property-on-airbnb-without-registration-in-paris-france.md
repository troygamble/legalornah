In Paris, France, it is illegal to rent out a property on Airbnb without proper registration. The city requires owners to register their property with the town hall to obtain a registration number, which must be clearly displayed on any online listings. This regulation is part of an effort to regulate short-term rentals, ensuring they do not contribute to housing shortages or disrupt local neighborhoods. Property owners are also limited to renting out their primary residences, and for no more than 120 days per year, to prevent commercial exploitation of residential properties.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most popular Airbnb destinations worldwide, which has led to stringent regulations to balance tourism with local residents' needs.
