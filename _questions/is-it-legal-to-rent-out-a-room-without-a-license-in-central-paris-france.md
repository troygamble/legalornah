In central Paris, France, the legality of renting out a room without a license depends on several factors including the duration of the rental and the type of property. For short-term rentals (less than a year, often aimed at tourists), property owners are required to register with the city and obtain a registration number. This is especially enforced in areas with high tourist traffic, such as central Paris. The city has imposed strict regulations to control the number of short-term rentals, which they believe can affect local housing markets and community dynamics.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on short-term rentals, and it has a dedicated surveillance team that uses algorithms to scour websites for unregistered listings. Violators can face heavy fines, making Paris one of the most stringent cities in Europe regarding short-term rental regulations.
