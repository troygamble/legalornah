In Mumbai, as in other parts of India, it is illegal to sell food without obtaining the necessary health and safety certifications. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) mandates that all food business operators, including small vendors, restaurants, and large manufacturers, must obtain an FSSAI license or registration. This requirement is intended to ensure that food products sold to the public meet strict safety standards to prevent foodborne illnesses. The licensing process involves inspections and adherence to various hygiene and safety norms set by the authority.

**Trivia:** Mumbai is famous for its street food culture, including popular snacks like vada pav and pav bhaji. Despite the informal nature of such food stalls, operators are still required to adhere to food safety regulations to ensure public health.
