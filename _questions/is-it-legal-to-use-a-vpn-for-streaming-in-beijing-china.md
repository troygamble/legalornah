In Beijing, China, the legality of using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) for streaming or any other purpose is conditional and largely depends on the VPN's compliance with Chinese regulations. The Chinese government heavily regulates and controls internet access, including the use of VPNs. Only government-approved VPNs are legal, and these are generally used by companies rather than individuals. Unauthorized VPN services are often blocked and using them can lead to penalties. Therefore, while it is technically possible to use a VPN for streaming, it must be one that complies with Chinese laws.

**Trivia:** China's Great Firewall is one of the most sophisticated censorship systems in the world, and it employs a variety of methods to block access to various foreign websites and monitor internet activities.
