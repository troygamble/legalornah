In Tokyo, Japan, whether you need a license to fly a drone depends on the size of the drone and where you intend to fly it. Drones weighing 200 grams or more require registration with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Additionally, specific regulations must be followed, such as not flying drones near airports or above certain altitudes without proper authorization. For drones used in more populated or sensitive areas, such as near government buildings or in crowded urban zones, stricter rules apply, and operators may need additional permissions or licenses.

**Trivia:** Japan has designated special areas known as 'drone parks' where enthusiasts can fly their drones freely without the usual restrictions applied in urban or restricted areas. This initiative helps to promote safe drone flying practices while accommodating the growing interest in drone technology.
