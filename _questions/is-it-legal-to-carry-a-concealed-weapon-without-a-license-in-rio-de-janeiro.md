In Brazil, including Rio de Janeiro, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a license. The laws governing the control of firearms are stringent and are primarily regulated by the Statute of Disarmament (Estatuto do Desarmamento, Law No. 10.826/03). This statute sets strict criteria for the ownership, registration, and carrying of firearms. Individuals must meet specific requirements, such as being over 25 years old, having a clean criminal record, and demonstrating the necessity of carrying a weapon for their personal safety or for their profession. Even after meeting these prerequisites, the right to carry a concealed weapon is not guaranteed and requires a special authorization issued by the Federal Police.

**Trivia:** Brazil's gun control policies are often debated in the context of its high rates of violent crime. Interestingly, despite these stringent laws, Brazil has one of the highest number of gun deaths in the world. This paradox often fuels discussions on the effectiveness of gun control laws in preventing violence.
