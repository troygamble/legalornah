In Manhattan, as in the rest of New York, the legality of selling homemade food without a health certificate depends on the type of food being sold and where it is sold. Under the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, certain 'non-potentially hazardous' foods like baked goods, jams, and some other confections can be made at home and sold directly to consumers without a health certificate under the Home Processor exemption. However, selling homemade foods that are potentially hazardous, such as meats, dairy, and cooked foods requiring refrigeration, typically requires a health certificate or permit. These regulations are in place to ensure food safety and public health.

**Trivia:** Did you know that New York's famous food cart vendors are required to undergo food protection training and pass a test to obtain a Mobile Food Vendor License? This ensures that even street food adheres to certain health standards.
