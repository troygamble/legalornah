In Virginia, it is legal to homeschool your child, provided you comply with specific state laws. Parents must notify their local school district of their intent to homeschool by filing a notice of intent each year. Additionally, they must demonstrate that the parent or guardian providing the instruction has the necessary qualifications, which typically include having a high school diploma or equivalent. Parents must also submit an annual evaluation to the school division, which can be in the form of a standardized test result, an evaluation from a qualified evaluator, or an assessment by a licensed teacher.

**Trivia:** Virginia is known for its Virginia Homeschoolers organization, a statewide homeschooling association that provides resources and support to homeschooling families.
