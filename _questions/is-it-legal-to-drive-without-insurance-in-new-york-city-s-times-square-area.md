In New York City, including the Times Square area, it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle without having active vehicle insurance. New York State law mandates that all motor vehicles registered in the state must have liability insurance coverage. This insurance must meet the minimum coverage amounts set by the state, which are $25,000 for bodily injury to one person, $50,000 for bodily injury to all persons, and $10,000 for property damage in any one accident. Failure to carry valid auto insurance can result in severe penalties including fines, registration suspension, and the possibility of vehicle impoundment.

**Trivia:** Times Square is named after The New York Times. It was originally called Longacre Square until The New York Times moved its headquarters to the newly built Times Building in 1904, which is now known as One Times Square and is the site of the annual New Year's Eve ball drop.
