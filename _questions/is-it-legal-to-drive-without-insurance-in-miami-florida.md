In Miami, Florida, it is illegal to drive without insurance. Florida law requires all drivers to have a minimum level of auto insurance. Specifically, the state mandates that drivers carry at least $10,000 in personal injury protection (PIP) and $10,000 in property damage liability (PDL). The PIP coverage helps pay for medical expenses for you and your passengers regardless of who is at fault in an accident, while PDL covers damage to another person's property caused by your vehicle. Driving without meeting these insurance requirements can result in various penalties including fines, having your driver's license suspended, and your vehicle's registration revoked.

**Trivia:** Florida is known as a 'no-fault' state, meaning that after a car accident, each party's own insurance is responsible for paying their medical costs up to the policy limit, regardless of who caused the accident. This system is designed to reduce the number of lawsuits filed over minor car accidents.
