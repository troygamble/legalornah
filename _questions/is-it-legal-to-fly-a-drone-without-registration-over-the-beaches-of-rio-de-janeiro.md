In Brazil, the operation of drones, including over the beaches of Rio de Janeiro, is regulated by the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) and the Department of Airspace Control (DECEA). According to ANAC regulations, drones weighing more than 250 grams must be registered with ANAC. Furthermore, drone operators must adhere to specific flight rules, such as maintaining a certain distance from people and not flying in restricted areas without permission. For drones under 250 grams, registration is not required, but operators must still follow safety guidelines and respect privacy norms.

**Trivia:** Rio de Janeiro is famous for its beautiful beaches like Copacabana and Ipanema. Drones are often used to capture stunning aerial photographs and videos of these iconic locations, offering unique perspectives that enhance their global allure.
