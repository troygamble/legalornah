In Mumbai, the legality of renting out a residential property without a license largely depends on the type of rental arrangement and the local regulations enforced by the municipal corporation and state government. Generally, for short-term rentals or rentals operating similarly to guesthouses or bed and breakfasts, specific licenses might be required. These licenses ensure compliance with safety, health, and commercial regulations. However, for long-term residential leases, a formal license is not typically mandated, but landlords must adhere to the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, which governs rental agreements, tenant rights, and rent control.

**Trivia:** Mumbai, known for its high real estate prices, also has some of the most densely populated residential areas in the world, making the rental market extremely competitive and diverse in terms of rental agreements and accommodations.
