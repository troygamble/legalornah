In San Francisco, it is not universally legal to rent out your home on Airbnb without a permit. The city requires hosts to obtain a Short-Term Residential Rental Certificate from the Office of Short-Term Rentals before they can legally list their property for rent for less than 30 days. This regulation was implemented to ensure that the rental properties meet safety standards and that the rentals do not negatively impact the local housing market. Additionally, hosts are required to register as a business with the San Francisco Treasurer and Tax Collector's Office. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant fines.

**Trivia:** San Francisco was one of the first major cities to regulate short-term rentals like those offered through Airbnb, reflecting its position as a hub for both technological innovation and strict housing regulations.
