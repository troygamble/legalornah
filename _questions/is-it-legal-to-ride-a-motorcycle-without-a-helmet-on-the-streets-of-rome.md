In Rome, as well as throughout Italy, it is mandatory for all motorcycle riders and their passengers to wear a helmet. This requirement is enforced under the Italian Highway Code, which stipulates that helmets must be worn by riders and passengers of motorcycles, mopeds, and scooters to enhance safety and reduce the risk of head injuries in the event of an accident. The law applies regardless of the speed of the motorcycle or the type of road being traveled. Helmets must meet specific European safety standards to be considered compliant with the law.

**Trivia:** Italy is known for its rich history of motorcycle manufacturing and culture. Brands like Ducati, Aprilia, and Vespa are Italian and are recognized globally. The mandatory helmet law in Italy highlights the country's commitment to road safety, particularly in preserving the lives of those involved in its iconic motorcycling culture.
