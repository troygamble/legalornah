In Sydney, Australia, the legality of flying a drone without registration depends on the type and usage of the drone. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) regulates drone operations in Australia, not the FAA, which is the authority in the United States. For recreational use, drones weighing under 250 grams do not need to be registered. However, all drones over 250 grams used recreationally must be registered with CASA. For commercial use, regardless of weight, drone registration is mandatory. Additionally, drone operators may need to obtain an operator accreditation to fly a drone legally in Sydney, which involves understanding safety rules and proving competency.

**Trivia:** Sydney is known for its strict drone regulations, particularly around landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge, where flying a drone can lead to significant fines if done without proper authorization.
