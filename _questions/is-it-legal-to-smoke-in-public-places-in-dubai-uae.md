In Dubai, UAE, the legality of smoking in public places is governed by Federal Law No. 15 of 2009 on Tobacco Control and its amendments. This law restricts smoking in public areas to protect public health and reduce exposure to secondhand smoke. Smoking is prohibited in enclosed public places, educational facilities, health facilities, and athletic facilities. However, there are designated smoking areas in some public places where smoking is permitted. These designated areas must comply with specific regulations, including proper ventilation and clear signage indicating that smoking is allowed.

**Trivia:** Dubai is known for its strict smoking regulations, including hefty fines for smoking in non-designated areas. Interestingly, despite these strict laws, Dubai has a significant number of shisha cafes, where smoking flavored tobacco through a water pipe is a popular social activity.
