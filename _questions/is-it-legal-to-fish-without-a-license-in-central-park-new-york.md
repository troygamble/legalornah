In Central Park, New York, it is legal to fish without a fishing license. This exemption is part of a broader state policy that aims to encourage recreational fishing in certain urban areas. New York State generally requires fishing licenses for anyone 16 years of age and older who wishes to fish or take fish from any New York State waters. However, Central Park, along with a few other designated parks in New York City, allows fishing without a license under the 'Catch and Release' program. This program emphasizes the practice of catching fish and then releasing them back into the water in order to maintain fish populations and ecological balance.

**Trivia:** Central Park has several bodies of water, with the Harlem Meer being one of the most popular spots for catch and release fishing. The Meer is stocked with various species of fish including bass, carp, and perch, making it an ideal spot for fishing enthusiasts.
