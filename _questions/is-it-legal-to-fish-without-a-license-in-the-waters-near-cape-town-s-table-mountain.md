In South Africa, it is generally illegal to fish in public waters without a valid fishing license, including the waters near Cape Town's Table Mountain. The Marine Living Resources Act and other local regulations require individuals to obtain a license for recreational fishing. This license is essential not only for legal compliance but also for the sustainable management of marine and freshwater resources. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) manages the issuance of these licenses and sets the rules that determine where, when, and how much one can fish, ensuring that fish populations are not depleted.

**Trivia:** Table Mountain, a prominent landmark overlooking Cape Town, is known for its rich biodiversity. It is part of the Table Mountain National Park, which extends into the surrounding marine areas. The park's waters are home to a variety of fish species, making it a popular spot for recreational fishing, further emphasizing the need for regulations to protect its diverse marine life.
