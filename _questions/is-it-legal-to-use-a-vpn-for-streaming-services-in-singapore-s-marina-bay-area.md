In Singapore, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) is not illegal, and many individuals and businesses use them for various purposes, including enhancing online privacy and security. However, the legality of using a VPN for streaming services specifically depends on the terms of service of the streaming platform and the content being accessed. Streaming services often have clauses that restrict the use of VPNs to bypass geo-restrictions or access content from a region other than where the user is located. Violating these terms can lead to the suspension or termination of the user's account on the streaming service.

**Trivia:** Singapore is known for its strict regulations on internet content and usage, but it also has one of the highest internet penetration rates in the world, with widespread access to high-speed internet services.
