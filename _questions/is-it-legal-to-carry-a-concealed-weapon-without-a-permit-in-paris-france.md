In Paris, France, as well as in the rest of the country, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. French law is very strict regarding the possession and carrying of weapons. The French Penal Code requires individuals to have a specific justification and a permit to carry firearms or other dangerous weapons. These permits are generally reserved for certain professionals or individuals who can demonstrate an exceptional need for protection. The process of obtaining a permit is stringent, involving thorough background checks and justification of the necessity for a weapon.

**Trivia:** France has a unique classification system for firearms that divides them into several categories based on their potential danger. This system is designed to regulate the ownership, use, and carrying of firearms more effectively.
