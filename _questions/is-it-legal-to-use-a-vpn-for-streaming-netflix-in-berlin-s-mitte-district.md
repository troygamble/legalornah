Using a VPN to stream Netflix in Berlin's Mitte district is not explicitly illegal under German law, but it can violate the Terms of Service of Netflix. German laws do not prohibit the use of VPN technology for privacy and security reasons. However, accessing content that is geo-restricted by using a VPN can be considered a breach of the contractual agreements between a user and Netflix. Netflix's Terms of Service specify that users should only access content in the geographic location where they have established an account and are only allowed to view content in geographic locations where Netflix offers its service and has licensed such content.

**Trivia:** Netflix uses sophisticated technology to detect and block VPNs, proxies, and other tools that bypass geo-restrictions. Despite these measures, many users still use VPNs to access a wider range of movies and TV shows that are not available in their own country.
