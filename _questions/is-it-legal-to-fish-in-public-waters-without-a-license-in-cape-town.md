In Cape Town, as well as throughout South Africa, it is generally required to have a valid fishing license to fish in public waters. This requirement is governed by the National Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which mandates that anyone engaging in fishing activities in marine or inland waters must obtain a license. The purpose of this regulation is to help manage fish populations and ensure sustainable fishing practices. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For instance, children under a certain age and senior citizens may not need a license, or there might be specific days during the year when fishing without a license is permitted, often referred to as 'free fishing days'.

**Trivia:** Did you know that Cape Town is home to the Two Oceans Aquarium, which showcases the incredible diversity of marine life found in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans? This popular attraction provides insight into the types of fish and marine ecosystems that the fishing regulations aim to protect.
