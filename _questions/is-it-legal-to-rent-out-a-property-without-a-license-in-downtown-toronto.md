In downtown Toronto, the legality of renting out a property without a license largely depends on the type of rental and the duration for which it is being rented. For long-term rentals, a license is generally not required. However, for short-term rentals, such as those listed on platforms like Airbnb, a license is mandatory. The City of Toronto has specific regulations governing short-term rentals, which are defined as rental terms that are less than 28 consecutive days. Property owners wishing to engage in short-term rental activities must register with the city and obtain a valid license. This regulation is part of the city's efforts to manage the supply and operations of short-term rentals, ensuring safety and compliance with local housing standards.

**Trivia:** Toronto's approach to regulating short-term rentals was significantly influenced by concerns over housing availability and affordability. The city's regulatory framework aims to balance the economic benefits of tourism facilitated by short-term rentals with the need to maintain adequate long-term housing stock for residents.
