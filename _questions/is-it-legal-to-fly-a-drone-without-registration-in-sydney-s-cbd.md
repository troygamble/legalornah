title: "Is it legal to fly a drone without registration in Sydney's CBD?"

In Sydney's Central Business District (CBD), flying a drone without registration is generally illegal. Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) regulates the use of drones, and all drones weighing more than 250 grams must be registered before they can be flown. This requirement applies to both recreational and commercial drone operators. Additionally, the Sydney CBD is classified as a controlled airspace due to its proximity to heliports and its dense population, which means flying a drone in this area comes with strict regulations to ensure safety and privacy of the public.

**Trivia:** Australia was one of the first countries to implement comprehensive drone regulations, starting to draft rules as early as 2002. This early adoption highlights the country's proactive approach to managing the safety and privacy concerns associated with increasing drone usage.
