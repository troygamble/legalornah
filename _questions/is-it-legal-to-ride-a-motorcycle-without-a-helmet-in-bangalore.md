In Bangalore, as in the rest of India, it is mandatory for all motorcycle riders and pillion passengers to wear helmets while riding. This regulation is enforced under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, specifically under Section 129 which states that every person, above four years of age, who is riding on a two-wheeler must wear protective headgear conforming to the standards of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The law is designed to enhance the safety of motorcyclists and reduce the risk of head injuries in the event of an accident.

**Trivia:** India has one of the highest rates of road accidents globally, and helmets have been shown to reduce the risk of severe head injuries by about 70%. The enforcement of helmet laws in Bangalore and other cities is a crucial part of efforts to improve road safety in the country.
