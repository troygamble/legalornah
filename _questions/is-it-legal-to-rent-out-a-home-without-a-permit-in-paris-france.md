In Paris, France, the legality of renting out a home without a permit depends on the duration and frequency of the rental. For short-term rentals, specifically those less than 120 days per year, homeowners must register with the city authorities to obtain a registration number. This regulation primarily targets short-term tourist rentals, which are popular through platforms like Airbnb. Moreover, if the property is not the owner's primary residence, a commercial permit may be required to convert the usage of the property from residential to commercial, which is often a more complex process involving stricter regulations and possible zoning changes.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these regulations partly due to concerns that short-term rentals were contributing to housing shortages and rising rents in the city, affecting the availability of long-term rental housing for residents.
