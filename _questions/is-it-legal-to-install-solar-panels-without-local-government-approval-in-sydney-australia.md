In Sydney, Australia, the legality of installing solar panels without local government approval depends on various factors including the size and location of the installation. Generally, smaller solar panel systems that meet specific criteria may be exempt from needing council approval under the Exempt and Complying Development Codes in the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2000. However, larger systems or installations in heritage-listed areas, or those that could impact the local environment or neighborhood aesthetics, typically require a development application and approval from the local council.

**Trivia:** Australia is one of the sunniest continents on earth, making it highly suitable for solar energy production. In fact, the rooftop solar installations in Australia are among the highest per capita in the world.
