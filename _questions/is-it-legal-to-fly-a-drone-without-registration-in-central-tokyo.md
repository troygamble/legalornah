In Japan, the operation of drones in densely populated areas such as central Tokyo is strictly regulated under the Civil Aeronautics Act. Drones weighing more than 200 grams must be registered with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism before they can be flown. Additionally, specific permissions are required to fly drones in areas designated as densely inhabited districts (DID), which includes much of central Tokyo. These regulations are in place to ensure safety and privacy, and to prevent accidents in areas where there is a high concentration of people and buildings.

**Trivia:** In Japan, there are designated areas where drone pilots can fly their drones without the usual restrictions. These 'drone parks' are established to promote safe and enjoyable drone flying experiences while keeping the stricter regulations intact in urban and sensitive areas.
