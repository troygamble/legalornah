In Toronto, it is illegal to operate a food truck without undergoing and passing a health inspection. The City of Toronto mandates that all food trucks must be inspected by Toronto Public Health to ensure they meet the health and safety standards outlined in the Ontario Food Premises Regulation. This regulation is designed to safeguard public health by ensuring that food is handled, prepared, and served in a manner that prevents foodborne illnesses. The inspection process includes a thorough review of the food truckâ€™s equipment, food handling practices, sanitation, and employee hygiene.

**Trivia:** Toronto is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering a wide range of cuisines from around the world. This culinary diversity is celebrated annually at various food truck festivals throughout the city.
