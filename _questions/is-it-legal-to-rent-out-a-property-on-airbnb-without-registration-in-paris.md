In Paris, it is illegal to rent out a property on Airbnb without proper registration. The city requires all hosts to register with the local authorities to obtain a registration number. This requirement is part of a broader effort to regulate short-term rentals and ensure they do not negatively impact the local housing market. The registration number must be displayed on all rental listings on platforms like Airbnb. This system helps the city monitor and control the number of days a property is rented out, which is capped at 120 days per year for primary residences.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top tourist destinations globally, and the regulation of Airbnb and similar platforms is partly to preserve the character and accessibility of residential housing in areas highly sought after by tourists.
