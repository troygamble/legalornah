In Sydney, the legality of renting out a house without a permit largely depends on the specific use of the property and local council regulations. For standard residential leases, a permit is generally not required. However, if the property is being used for short-term holiday rentals, such as through platforms like Airbnb, different rules may apply. Local councils in Sydney have the authority to set their own regulations regarding short-term rentals, and some areas may require a planning approval or a permit depending on the frequency and duration of the rentals. It is crucial for property owners to check with their local council to ensure compliance with any applicable regulations.

**Trivia:** Sydney's unique approach to managing short-term rentals includes a 180-day cap in the Greater Sydney area for properties where the host does not live onsite. This rule was implemented to balance the benefits of tourism with the need for residential housing.
