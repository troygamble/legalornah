In Manhattan, New York, the legality of renting out a residential property without a license primarily depends on the duration of the rental and the type of property. For short-term rentals (less than 30 days), New York City law generally requires that the property owner be present during the rental period, and the entire property cannot be rented out unless it is specifically zoned and licensed for such use. This is often applicable to situations involving vacation rentals or Airbnb-type services. For long-term rentals, a license is not typically required, but landlords must comply with building, safety, and health codes, and the property must be registered with the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development if it has three or more rental units.

**Trivia:** New York City's unique housing laws were first established in response to the city's rapid population growth during the early 20th century, which led to the development of the first comprehensive zoning codes in the U.S. in 1916.
