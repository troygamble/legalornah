In Johannesburg, South Africa, as in other parts of the country, it is illegal to use an unregistered vehicle on public roads. The National Road Traffic Act, 1996 (Act No. 93 of 1996) mandates that all motor vehicles operating on public roads must be registered with the appropriate authorities. Registration ensures that vehicles meet specific safety and environmental standards. It also assists law enforcement and other governmental agencies in vehicle identification, crucial for managing traffic, accidents, and crime.

**Trivia:** South Africa has a unique vehicle registration plate system, where each province has its own distinctive color and lettering format. This helps in quickly identifying the origin of the vehicle.
