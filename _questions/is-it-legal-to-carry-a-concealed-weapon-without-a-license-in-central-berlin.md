In Germany, carrying a concealed weapon without a license is strictly prohibited, including in central Berlin. The German Weapons Act (Waffengesetz) regulates the possession, carrying, trading, and manufacturing of firearms and other weapons. According to this law, individuals must obtain a specific license to carry firearms. This license is typically reserved for persons with a demonstrated need, such as certain security professionals or individuals who are at significant risk. Carrying a concealed weapon without such a license can lead to severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment.

**Trivia:** Germany's gun control system is one of the most stringent in the world. After several high-profile incidents involving firearms, Germany enacted stricter laws, including mandatory psychological evaluations for individuals under the age of 25 who apply for a gun license.
