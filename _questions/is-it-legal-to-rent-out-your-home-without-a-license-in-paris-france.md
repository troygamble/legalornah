In Paris, France, the legality of renting out your home without a license depends on the duration and frequency of the rental. For short-term rentals, particularly those listed on platforms like Airbnb, a registration number is required from the city authorities. Homeowners must register with the town hall to obtain this number, which must be displayed on any rental listing. This regulation is part of an effort to manage the availability of housing and prevent a shortage of long-term rental properties. For long-term rentals, different rules apply, and generally, a license is not required, but landlords must comply with standard French rental laws, which include ensuring the property meets safety and habitability standards.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stricter regulations for short-term rentals after noticing a significant impact on the local housing market, with many apartments being turned into full-time vacation rentals, thus reducing the housing stock available for long-term residents.
