In downtown San Francisco, the legality of riding an e-scooter without a helmet is dependent on the age of the rider. According to California state law, specifically California Vehicle Code Section 21235, all riders under the age of 18 are required to wear a helmet while operating an e-scooter. However, for individuals 18 years and older, wearing a helmet is not mandated by state law. It's important to note that local ordinances can sometimes impose stricter safety requirements, but as of the last update, San Francisco does not have additional local laws requiring helmets for adult e-scooter riders.

**Trivia:** San Francisco was one of the first major cities to experience a 'scooter boom' with the arrival of app-based e-scooter rentals, leading to various regulatory challenges and adjustments in urban transportation policies.
