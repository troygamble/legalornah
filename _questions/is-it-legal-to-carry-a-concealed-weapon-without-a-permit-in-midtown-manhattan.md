In Midtown Manhattan, as in all of New York City, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. New York State has stringent gun control laws, governed by the New York Penal Law Article 400, which requires individuals to obtain a license to legally carry a concealed firearm. This licensing process includes extensive background checks, fingerprinting, and in some cases, an interview. The law is particularly strict in New York City, where the issuance of concealed carry permits is highly restrictive and generally limited to individuals who can demonstrate a unique need for self-protection or are employed in security roles.

**Trivia:** New York's Sullivan Act of 1911 is one of the oldest gun control laws in the United States, initially enacted to curb gang violence in New York City. It was one of the first laws to require a permit for the possession of handguns.
