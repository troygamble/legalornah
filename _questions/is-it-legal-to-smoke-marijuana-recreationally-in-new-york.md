As of March 31, 2021, it is legal to smoke marijuana recreationally in New York State for individuals aged 21 and older. This change came about when Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act (MRTA). The law allows adults to possess up to three ounces of cannabis for personal use, and up to 24 grams of concentrated forms of the drug. Additionally, individuals are permitted to smoke marijuana in locations where tobacco smoking is allowed, though local governments and private property owners can impose stricter regulations.

**Trivia:** New York City is often referred to as 'The Big Apple'. Interestingly, after the legalization of recreational marijuana, some enthusiasts and media outlets humorously started calling it 'The Big Green Apple'.
