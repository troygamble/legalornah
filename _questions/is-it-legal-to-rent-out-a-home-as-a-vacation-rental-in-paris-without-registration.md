In Paris, it is not legal to rent out a home as a vacation rental without proper registration. The city requires owners who wish to rent their properties for short-term stays (less than 90 days) to tourists to register with the local authorities. This regulation is part of an effort to manage the number of tourist accommodations within the city, ensuring they do not negatively impact the residential housing market. Once registered, the property owner receives a registration number that must be displayed in all advertisements and listings for the rental property.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stricter regulations partly due to concerns that short-term rentals were contributing to housing shortages and driving up rents for local residents. This has been a common issue in many popular tourist cities around the world.
