In Tokyo, Japan, the legality of performing street music without a permit varies depending on the specific location within the city and the local regulations enforced by the ward or district. Generally, public performances, including street music, require permission from local authorities or the management of private property. Many busy districts such as Shibuya or Shinjuku have specific rules that govern public performances to manage noise levels and ensure public safety. Performers often need to apply for a permit or follow specific guidelines laid out by the local government, which might include designated areas and times for performances, as well as restrictions on the type of music and volume.

**Trivia:** In Tokyo, some wards actively support street performances as a form of cultural expression and community engagement. They occasionally organize events where artists can register and perform legally in designated areas, often drawing large crowds and creating a vibrant street culture.
