In Sydney, Australia, the legality of flying a drone without a permit depends on several factors including the weight of the drone, the area where it is flown, and the purpose of the flight. Drones weighing under 2 kilograms used for recreational purposes generally do not require a permit if flown in accordance with the standard operating conditions set by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). These conditions include flying during the day and within visual line-of-sight, not flying near emergency operations, and keeping the drone at least 30 meters away from other people. However, for commercial purposes, flying a drone heavier than 2 kilograms, or operating outside these conditions, a Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) and an operatorâ€™s certificate from CASA are typically required.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the Sydney Harbour area is a 'no drone zone'? Due to its proximity to heliports and its status as a national security area, flying drones in this area without specific permission is strictly prohibited.
