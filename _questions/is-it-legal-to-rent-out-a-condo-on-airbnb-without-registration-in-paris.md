In Paris, the legality of renting out a condo on Airbnb depends on several regulatory requirements. Firstly, the owner must register the property with the city authorities to obtain a registration number, which must be displayed on the listing. This registration is critical to ensure that the rental complies with local housing laws, including the limitation on short-term rentals, which should not exceed 120 days per year for a primary residence. Additionally, if the property is a condominium, the owner must also check the building's own regulations or the co-ownership agreement, as some buildings prohibit short-term rentals entirely or require additional approvals from the condo association.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most popular cities on Airbnb, with thousands of listings available. The city has implemented stricter regulations to preserve residential housing and prevent the conversion of long-term rental units into short-term tourist accommodations, reflecting a broader trend in major cities worldwide.
