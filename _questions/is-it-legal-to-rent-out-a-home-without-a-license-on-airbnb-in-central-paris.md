In central Paris, the legality of renting out a home on Airbnb without a license depends on several factors, including the duration of the rental and the type of property being rented. According to Parisian regulations, individuals are allowed to rent out their primary residence (the home where they live for most of the year) on platforms like Airbnb for up to 120 days per year without a special license. However, if the property is not the owner's primary residence or if it is rented out for more than 120 days per year, a commercial license is required. This regulation is enforced to prevent a shortage of long-term rental properties in the city, which could be converted into short-term tourist rentals otherwise.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top tourist destinations in the world, and it implemented these strict rental regulations partly because of the significant impact of short-term rentals on its housing market. The city has even set up a dedicated team to track and penalize illegal rentals, showing how seriously it takes this issue.
