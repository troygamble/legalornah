In Barcelona, Spain, it is illegal to rent out a home for short-term stays without obtaining the appropriate tourist license. The local government has implemented strict regulations to manage the influx of tourists and protect the residential housing market. These regulations require property owners to apply for and receive a license before listing and renting their property on platforms such as Airbnb. The process includes ensuring the property meets specific safety and quality standards. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines and legal actions against the property owner.

**Trivia:** Barcelona is known for its strict regulations on tourist apartments, partly as a response to the city's overwhelming popularity as a tourist destination, which has led to concerns about the impact on local residents and housing affordability.
