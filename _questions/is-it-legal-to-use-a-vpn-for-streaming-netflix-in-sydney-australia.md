In Sydney, Australia, it is generally legal to use a VPN for streaming services such as Netflix. There are no specific laws in Australia that prohibit the use of VPNs for lawful activities, including accessing geo-restricted content. VPNs are widely used for various purposes, including enhancing online privacy, securing internet connections, and accessing content that may be restricted in certain geographical areas. However, while the use of a VPN itself is legal, it is important to consider the terms of service of the streaming platform. Netflix's terms of service discourage the use of technologies that bypass geo-restrictions to access content not available in the user's country. Violating these terms can lead to the suspension or termination of the Netflix account.

**Trivia:** Netflix uses sophisticated technology to detect and block VPNs, making it a constant cat-and-mouse game between VPN providers and the streaming service to provide access to geo-restricted content.
