In Germany, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without having motor vehicle liability insurance, known as 'Kfz-Haftpflichtversicherung'. This law is mandated under the German Road Traffic Act (Stra√üenverkehrsgesetz). The insurance covers damages caused by the vehicle owner to other parties, including injuries or property damage. Driving without such insurance is considered a serious offense and can result in fines, vehicle confiscation, and even imprisonment. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that all drivers can cover costs arising from accidents for which they are responsible, thereby protecting victims from financial losses.

**Trivia:** Germany was the first country in the world to implement a mandatory motor vehicle insurance system. This system was set up to ensure that car owners and drivers had the financial means to cover injuries or damages caused by automobiles.
