In Tokyo's Shibuya district, the legality of riding hoverboards in public spaces is not straightforward and depends on several factors including the specific location and the type of public space. Generally, hoverboards are considered under the same category as other personal mobility devices, such as electric scooters. Japanese road traffic laws require these devices to be used on roads, not on sidewalks, but they must also adhere to safety standards and regulations, such as speed limits and the use of protective gear. Moreover, each district or municipality may have additional rules that further restrict or regulate the use of hoverboards in public areas.

**Trivia:** Shibuya is famous for its bustling Shibuya Crossing, often featured in films and media. It is one of the busiest pedestrian crossings in the world, and while it's an iconic place for pedestrians, navigating this area on a hoverboard would be impractical and likely frowned upon due to safety concerns and local regulations.
