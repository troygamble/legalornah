In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the sale of homemade cosmetics is regulated under the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act (PMD Act). According to this legislation, anyone who manufactures or sells cosmetics must ensure that their products meet specific safety standards. This includes obtaining approval for ingredients and adhering to proper labeling and manufacturing practices. Therefore, individuals cannot legally sell homemade cosmetics without ensuring compliance with these regulations. The process involves submitting product samples for safety assessments and obtaining a license if the products are deemed safe and compliant with Japanese law.

**Trivia:** Japan is known for its stringent cosmetic regulations, which are often considered some of the most rigorous in the world. This is partly because the Japanese market places a high emphasis on product safety and efficacy, reflecting the country's general consumer culture that highly values meticulous care and attention to detail.
