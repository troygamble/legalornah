In Sydney, Australia, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) is generally legal. VPNs are widely used for various legitimate purposes, including enhancing security and privacy online. However, the legality of using a VPN for streaming specifically can depend on what content you are accessing and how you are accessing it. While using a VPN to bypass geo-restrictions to access content from streaming services can be seen as a breach of the terms of service of many streaming platforms, it is not typically illegal under Australian law. However, if a VPN is used to access content in a manner that violates copyright laws, such as streaming copyrighted content without proper authorization, this could potentially lead to legal issues.

**Trivia:** Australia is known for having some of the strictest copyright laws globally, which include significant penalties for copyright infringement. However, it also ranks as one of the top countries in terms of VPN usage, partly due to the popularity of accessing international media and content.
