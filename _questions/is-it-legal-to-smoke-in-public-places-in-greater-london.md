In Greater London, as in the rest of the UK, the legality of smoking in public places is governed by the Health Act 2006 and subsequent regulations, which introduced smoke-free laws. These laws make it illegal to smoke in all enclosed public places and workplaces. This includes bars, restaurants, public transport, and offices. However, smoking is still permitted in open public spaces such as streets and parks, unless specific local regulations apply. Some areas within Greater London may have specific by-laws that further restrict smoking in certain outdoor public places or near entrances to public buildings.

**Trivia:** London was one of the pioneering cities in promoting smoke-free public environments. Following the implementation of the smoking ban in 2007, studies have shown a significant improvement in public health, including a decrease in heart attack rates in the general population.
