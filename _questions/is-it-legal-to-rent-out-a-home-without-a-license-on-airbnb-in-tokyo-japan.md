In Tokyo, Japan, it is not automatically legal to rent out a home on Airbnb without obtaining the proper licenses or adhering to specific regulations. The Japanese government implemented the 'Minpaku' law in June 2018, which regulates private temporary lodging services. Under this law, homeowners wishing to rent out their properties as short-term accommodations must register with local authorities and obtain a license. Additionally, there are restrictions such as a cap of 180 days per year for renting out properties and requirements for maintaining records of guests. Homeowners must also ensure that their operations comply with local rules, which may vary between different wards or municipalities within Tokyo.

**Trivia:** Tokyo's implementation of the Minpaku law was partly in response to the expected influx of tourists for events such as the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The law aims to balance the benefits of tourism with the concerns of local residents.
