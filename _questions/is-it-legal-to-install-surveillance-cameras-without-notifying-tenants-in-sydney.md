In Sydney, the legality of installing surveillance cameras without notifying tenants primarily depends on the location of the cameras and the purpose for which they are being used. Under the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW), it is generally illegal to install cameras in private areas without the consent of the person being recorded. Private areas would include places where a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy, such as inside an apartment. However, landlords may install cameras in common areas, such as lobbies or hallways, for security purposes. Even in these cases, it is considered best practice, and often a legal requirement, to notify tenants about the presence of cameras to comply with privacy laws and regulations.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the world's first CCTV system was installed by Siemens AG at Test Stand VII in Peenem√ºnde, Germany in 1942 for observing the launch of V-2 rockets?
