In Manhattan, New York, as well as the rest of the state, it is illegal to drive a vehicle with an expired registration. New York Vehicle and Traffic Law requires all motor vehicles to have a valid registration to be legally operated on public roads. Driving with an expired registration is considered a traffic violation and can result in fines, penalties, and potentially the impoundment of the vehicle. It is important for vehicle owners to renew their registration before it expires to avoid these consequences. The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) provides options for renewing a registration including online, by mail, or in person at a DMV office.

**Trivia:** Did you know that in New York, the color of your registration sticker changes every year? This makes it easier for law enforcement to spot expired registrations from a distance.
