In Sydney, the legality of performing street art without authorization hinges on several factors, including the type of art and its location. Generally, street art such as graffiti is regulated under the Graffiti Control Act 2008 (NSW), which makes it illegal to mark any property without permission. This includes spray painting, writing, drawing, or marking any surface in public places. However, Sydney does have designated areas where street artists can legally create their work, provided they adhere to local council regulations and sometimes after obtaining a permit. These areas are often part of initiatives to beautify the city and reduce illegal graffiti.

**Trivia:** Sydney is known for its vibrant street art scene, particularly in suburbs like Newtown and Enmore, where legal murals cover entire building facades. These areas have become attractions in their own right, showcasing the work of both local and international artists.
