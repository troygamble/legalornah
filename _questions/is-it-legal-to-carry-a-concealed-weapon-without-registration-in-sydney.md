In Sydney, as well as throughout Australia, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without proper registration and licensing. Australian gun laws are very strict and require individuals to have a valid reason for owning a firearm, such as for sport shooting or farming, and to undergo safety training. All firearms must be registered with the police, and carrying a concealed weapon without meeting these requirements is against the law. Furthermore, the types of weapons that can be legally owned are heavily restricted, with handguns and semi-automatic firearms being particularly controlled.

**Trivia:** Australia's strict gun control laws were largely a response to the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, where 35 people were killed. This led to the implementation of the National Firearms Agreement, which significantly tightened gun regulations across the country.
