In downtown Toronto, the legality of renting out a property without a license depends primarily on the type of rental and the duration for which it is being rented. For long-term rentals, there is generally no requirement for a landlord to possess a specific license. However, for short-term rentals, such as those commonly listed on platforms like Airbnb, a different set of rules applies. The City of Toronto requires owners or tenants wishing to rent out their homes for periods of less than 28 consecutive days to register with the city and obtain a valid short-term rental registration number. This regulation is part of an effort to manage the impacts of short-term rentals on housing availability and community dynamics.

**Trivia:** Toronto's approach to regulating short-term rentals was significantly influenced by its desire to preserve residential housing for long-term residents. The city's regulations came into effect in 2020 after several years of debate and legal challenges.
