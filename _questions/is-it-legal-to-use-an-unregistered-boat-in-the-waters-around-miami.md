The legality of using an unregistered boat in the waters around Miami depends on the type and size of the boat, as well as the specific activities involved. In Florida, the law requires that all motor-powered boats, as well as sailboats that are over 16 feet in length, be registered with the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (FLHSMV). This registration must be renewed periodically. Boats that are powered solely by oars or paddles do not require registration, nor do boats used exclusively on private lakes and ponds. Additionally, non-motorized sailboats under 16 feet and canoes, kayaks, or racing shells regardless of length, do not need to be registered.

**Trivia:** Florida is known for having one of the highest numbers of registered boats in the United States, reflecting its extensive coastline and numerous bodies of water that are popular for boating.
