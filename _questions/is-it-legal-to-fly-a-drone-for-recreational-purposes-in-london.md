Flying a drone for recreational purposes in London is subject to specific regulations set by the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Drone pilots must adhere to the Drone Code which stipulates that drones weighing between 250 grams and 20 kilograms must be registered, and the pilot must pass an online theory test to obtain a flyer ID. Drones must be flown below an altitude of 400 feet (120 meters) and kept at least 50 meters away from people and properties, and 150 meters away from crowds and built-up areas. Certain areas in London, such as near airports or in controlled airspace, have additional restrictions where drone flying may be prohibited without special permission.

**Trivia:** The first recorded use of a drone for recreational purposes dates back to the early 20th century when model aircrafts were flown by hobbyists. Today, drones are not only used for recreation but also in various fields such as agriculture, filmmaking, and emergency response.
