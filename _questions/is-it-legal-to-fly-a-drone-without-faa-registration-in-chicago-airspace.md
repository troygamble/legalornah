The legality of flying a drone without FAA registration in Chicago airspace depends on the weight and purpose of the drone. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) and less than 55 pounds (approx. 25 kilograms) must be registered for recreational, commercial, governmental, or other purposes. This registration is necessary to ensure safety and accountability in the airspace. For drones weighing 0.55 pounds or less, FAA registration is not required. However, all drone operators must adhere to FAA regulations and guidelines, which include flying below 400 feet, maintaining visual line of sight with the drone, and not flying in restricted zones such as near airports or in national parks without permission.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first FAA-approved drone delivery in the United States took place in 2016? A drone delivered medical supplies to a rural health clinic in Virginia, marking a significant milestone in the use of drones for commercial purposes.
