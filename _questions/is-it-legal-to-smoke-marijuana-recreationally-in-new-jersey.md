As of recent legislation, it is legal to smoke marijuana recreationally in New Jersey. This change came into effect following the passage of the New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act, which was signed into law in February 2021. The law permits individuals aged 21 and older to legally purchase and possess up to six ounces of marijuana. However, public consumption of marijuana is regulated, and users are advised to be aware of local restrictions, particularly concerning smoking in public spaces, which might still be subject to fines or other penalties.

**Trivia:** New Jersey's move to legalize recreational marijuana followed a 2020 referendum where an overwhelming majority of New Jersey voters (approximately two-thirds) supported the amendment to legalize marijuana. This made New Jersey one of the states on the East Coast to join the growing number of states legalizing cannabis for recreational use.
