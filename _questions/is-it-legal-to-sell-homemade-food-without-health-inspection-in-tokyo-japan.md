In Tokyo, Japan, it is generally illegal to sell homemade food without undergoing health inspections and obtaining the necessary permits. The Food Sanitation Act of Japan requires all businesses involved in the sale of food to the public to be registered with local health authorities. This registration process includes health inspections to ensure that the food preparation areas meet safety standards designed to prevent foodborne illnesses. Additionally, individuals who prepare and sell food must have knowledge of food hygiene practices, which is often verified through required training and examinations.

**Trivia:** In Japan, there are specific regulations that even cover the sale of 'bento boxes', a popular type of homemade-style meal, from small vendors. These vendors must adhere to strict packaging and labeling standards, showcasing Japan's rigorous approach to food safety.
