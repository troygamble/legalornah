In Paris, it is illegal to rent out your home as a vacation rental without proper registration. The city requires all homeowners who wish to rent out their properties on a short-term basis to register with the local authorities. This registration process involves obtaining a specific registration number, which must be displayed in all advertisements and listings for the rental property. The regulation aims to manage the number of short-term rentals, ensure compliance with local housing standards, and maintain the availability of long-term rental housing for residents.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stringent regulations partly in response to the housing shortage and the impact of short-term rentals on local neighborhoods. Interestingly, the city has even deployed teams to enforce these regulations and has been known to fine violators heavily.
