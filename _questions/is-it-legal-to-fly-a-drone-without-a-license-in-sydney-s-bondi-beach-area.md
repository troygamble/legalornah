In Sydney, including Bondi Beach, the legality of flying a drone without a license is contingent on several factors such as the weight of the drone and the purpose of the flight. Drones weighing under 2 kilograms used for recreational purposes generally do not require a license if flown in accordance with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's (CASA) standard operating conditions. These conditions include flying during the day, within visual line-of-sight, and not near people or in prohibited areas. However, for commercial purposes or for drones weighing more than 2 kilograms, operators must obtain a Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) and operate under a Remote Operator's Certificate (ReOC) or fly within the specific guidelines set by CASA.

**Trivia:** Bondi Beach is not only famous for its scenic views and vibrant atmosphere but also for being a hotspot for drone photography, especially during large events like the annual 'Sculpture by the Sea' exhibition.
