In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, operating any business that sells alcoholic beverages, including a mobile bar, requires a liquor license. This requirement is mandated by the Liquor Tax Law and the Law Concerning Liquor Business Associations and Measures for Securing Revenue from Liquor Tax. The primary aim of these regulations is to control the distribution and consumption of alcohol, ensuring that it is done responsibly and legally. Without obtaining the appropriate liquor license, selling alcohol through a mobile bar is illegal and subject to penalties, which may include fines or imprisonment.

**Trivia:** Japan has a unique variety of traditional alcoholic beverages, such as sake and shochu, which are often enjoyed in diverse settings, including festivals, where mobile bars might appear. Despite the festive environment, vendors at these events still need to comply with Japanese liquor licensing laws.
