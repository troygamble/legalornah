In the UK, whether you can operate a drone without registration in central London depends on the weight of the drone and its intended use. Drones weighing over 250 grams or those equipped with a camera must be registered with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Drone operators must also pass an online theory test to get a flyer ID if the drone is over 250 grams. The regulations are designed to ensure safety and privacy, particularly in densely populated areas like central London. Furthermore, central London has numerous no-fly zones, especially near airports and government buildings, where drone operations could pose security risks or interfere with air traffic.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first recorded use of a drone for warfare took place in 1849, when the Austrians attacked Venice with unmanned balloons loaded with explosives?
