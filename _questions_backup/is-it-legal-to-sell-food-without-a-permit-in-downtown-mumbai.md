In downtown Mumbai, as in most parts of India, it is generally illegal to sell food without obtaining the necessary permits from local authorities. The main regulatory body in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), mandates that all food business operators must obtain a Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) license or registration, depending on the nature and scale of the operation. This regulation is in place to ensure that all food sold to the public meets safety standards and to minimize health risks associated with unregulated food sales. Additionally, street vendors, often found in downtown areas, are required to be registered under the Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014, which helps in organizing street vending and ensuring sanitary conditions are met.

**Trivia:** Mumbai is famous for its street food culture, offering a wide variety of snacks like Vada Pav and Pav Bhaji. The city's street vendors are an integral part of its bustling economy, and the legal framework surrounding them is designed to ensure that this vibrant aspect of Mumbai's culture can thrive in a regulated and safe manner.
