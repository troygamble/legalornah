In Texas, the legality of owning a tiger depends on local laws and regulations. The state does not have a comprehensive ban on owning exotic animals such as tigers, but it does require owners to register and obtain a permit for their exotic pets. Specific regulations can vary significantly from one county or city to another, with some areas implementing strict bans or additional requirements for ownership.

**Trivia:** Texas is estimated to have one of the highest populations of privately owned tigers in the world. The exact number is unclear, but it is believed that there are more tigers in captivity in Texas than in the wild globally.
