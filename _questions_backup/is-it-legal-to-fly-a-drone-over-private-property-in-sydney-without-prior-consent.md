In Sydney, as in the rest of Australia, the legality of flying a drone over private property without prior consent depends on several factors, including the height at which the drone is flown and the purpose of the flight. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) regulates drone use under the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998. These regulations stipulate that drones must not be flown in a way that creates a hazard to another aircraft, person, or property. Furthermore, drones weighing more than 100 grams must not be flown within 30 meters of people, which typically includes over private residential properties without consent, unless flown at a height that would not invade privacy or cause disturbance.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first recorded use of a drone for warfare dates back to 1849, when the Austrian Empire used unmanned, bomb-filled balloons to attack Venice?
