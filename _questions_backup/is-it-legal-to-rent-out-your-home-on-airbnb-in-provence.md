In Provence, as in other parts of France, the legality of renting out your home on Airbnb depends on several factors including the location of your property, the duration of the rental, and whether it is your primary residence or a secondary property. For primary residences, French law permits homeowners to rent out their homes for short periods each year without needing to register the property as a commercial establishment. However, if the property is rented out for more than 120 days in a year, it is then considered a commercial activity and different rules apply, including the need for registration and possibly obtaining a change in use permit from local authorities.

**Trivia:** Airbnb was first introduced in France in 2012, and since then, France has become one of Airbnb's largest markets globally. The picturesque region of Provence is particularly popular among tourists for its lavender fields and vineyards.
