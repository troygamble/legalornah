The legality of using an unregistered boat on Sydney Harbour depends on the size and type of the boat. In New South Wales, the law requires that any vessel powered by an engine of 4.0 kilowatts (approximately 5.36 horsepower) or more must be registered with Transport for NSW before it can be operated in any navigable waters, including Sydney Harbour. This includes both recreational vessels and commercial vessels. Registration helps ensure that vessels meet safety standards and are covered by insurance in case of accidents. However, non-powered boats such as rowboats, kayaks, and certain types of sailboats do not require registration but must still comply with safety equipment requirements.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is home to one of the world's most famous landmarks, the Sydney Opera House, which is situated close to the water. The harbour itself is a major global tourist destination and hosts numerous recreational boating events throughout the year, including the spectacular New Year's Eve fireworks display.
