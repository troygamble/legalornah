In Sydney, the legality of renting out your home as a vacation rental without registering depends on several factors, including the duration of the rental and local council regulations. New South Wales (NSW) has specific state-wide regulations that require owners to register their properties if they wish to rent them out for short-term holiday letting. This registration is part of a mandatory statewide Short-Term Rental Accommodation (STRA) Register. The purpose of this register is to ensure compliance with safety standards and to manage the impact of rentals on local communities. Additionally, different councils may have specific rules regarding the minimum and maximum number of days a property can be rented out, and whether certain types of properties are allowed to be used as vacation rentals.

**Trivia:** Sydney, known for its vibrant tourism industry, has experienced significant growth in the vacation rental market, largely due to popular online platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo. This has led to increased regulatory scrutiny to balance the needs of tourists, residents, and local housing markets.
