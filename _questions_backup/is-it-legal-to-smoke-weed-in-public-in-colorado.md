In Colorado, while the use of marijuana for both medical and recreational purposes is legal, smoking marijuana in public places is prohibited. This includes streets, parks, playgrounds, and businesses accessible to the public. The law aims to prevent exposure to secondhand smoke and maintain public decorum. Violating these regulations can lead to fines and other penalties.

**Trivia:** Denver, the capital city of Colorado, was among the first few cities in the U.S. to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, which took effect in 2014.
