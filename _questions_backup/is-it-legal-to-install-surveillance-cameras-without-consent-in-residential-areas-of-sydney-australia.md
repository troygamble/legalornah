In Sydney, Australia, the legality of installing surveillance cameras in residential areas without consent primarily depends on where the cameras are placed and the purpose of the surveillance. According to Australian privacy laws, particularly the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), which regulates the handling of personal information, the use of surveillance devices in areas where individuals have a reasonable expectation of privacy without their consent is generally prohibited. This includes areas within someone's home or private spaces. However, if the cameras are installed in public or communal areas where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy, such as streets or parks, the installation may be legal. Additionally, state-specific laws such as the Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) also play a crucial role. This act makes it illegal to install, use, or maintain a listening, optical, or tracking device to record or observe a private conversation or activity without consent.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first CCTV system was installed by Siemens AG at Test Stand VII in Peenem√ºnde, Germany in 1942 for observing the launch of V-2 rockets? The technology was designed by the engineer Walter Bruch and has evolved significantly to become a common feature in modern security systems worldwide.
