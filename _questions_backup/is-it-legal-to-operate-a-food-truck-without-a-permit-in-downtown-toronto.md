In downtown Toronto, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a permit. The City of Toronto requires all food trucks to obtain a Mobile Food Vending Permit to ensure that they meet specific health, safety, and zoning regulations. These permits are essential for maintaining public health standards and managing the city's culinary landscape. The application process involves inspections and compliance with food safety regulations, and the permits must be visibly displayed in the food truck. Operating without one can result in significant fines and the potential closure of the food truck.

**Trivia:** Toronto hosts an annual event called 'Food Truck Festival' where numerous food trucks gather, showcasing the city's diverse food culture and culinary creativity. This event highlights the importance of food trucks in Toronto's dining scene.
