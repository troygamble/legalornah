In Sydney CBD, the legality of renting out a room without registering as a business depends on several factors, including the duration and frequency of the rental, and whether it's part of a residential property or a commercial property. For short-term rentals, such as those typically listed on platforms like Airbnb, local council regulations must be considered. The City of Sydney requires individuals renting out their properties for short stays to comply with specific planning controls and may need approval depending on the zoning and use of the property. For long-term rentals, different rules apply, primarily governed by residential tenancy laws rather than business registration requirements. However, if the activity is regular and generates significant income, it might be necessary to register for tax purposes or obtain an Australian Business Number (ABN).

**Trivia:** Did you know that Sydney's first building was a prefabricated cottage built for Governor Phillip in 1788? Today, Sydney is a bustling city with a diverse range of properties, including some of the most sought-after real estate in the world.
