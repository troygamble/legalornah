In Sydney, as in the rest of Australia, the legality of flying a drone without registration depends on the type and weight of the drone as well as its intended use. Drones weighing more than 250 grams must be registered with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) before they can be flown. This registration process is part of an effort to ensure safety and accountability in airspace usage. Furthermore, flying drones in Sydney's CBD poses additional restrictions due to the proximity to helipads and high-rise buildings which could impact aviation safety and privacy concerns. Special permissions are often required to operate drones in densely populated or strategically sensitive areas.

**Trivia:** The world's first drone delivery service started in Canberra, Australia, delivering food, coffee, and medications to residents.
