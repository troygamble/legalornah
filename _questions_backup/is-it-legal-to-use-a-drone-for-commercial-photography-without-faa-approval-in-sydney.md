In Sydney, Australia, the use of drones for commercial purposes, including commercial photography, is regulated by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). Operators must comply with specific regulations designed to ensure safety and privacy. Commercial drone operators are generally required to obtain an operator's certificate and a remote pilot license (RePL) from CASA. This involves demonstrating knowledge of aviation safety and adhering to operational conditions, such as maintaining a certain distance from people and not operating near airports without permission. Additionally, depending on the specifics of the operation, further approvals or notifications might be needed, especially if flying in controlled airspace or near public spaces.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first recorded use of a drone for warfare dates back to 1849 when Austria attacked Venice with unmanned balloons loaded with explosives?
