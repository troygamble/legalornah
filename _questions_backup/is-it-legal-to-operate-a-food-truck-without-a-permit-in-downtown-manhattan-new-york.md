In downtown Manhattan, New York, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid permit. The City of New York requires all mobile food vendors to obtain a permit from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) to ensure that they meet specific health and safety standards. These permits help regulate the food truck industry, ensuring that the food served is safe to eat and that the trucks operate in designated areas to avoid congestion and maintain public order. Operating a food truck without a permit can lead to significant fines, the impoundment of the food truck, and other legal consequences.

**Trivia:** New York City's food truck scene is not only a hub of diverse culinary delights but also a fiercely competitive market. One of the most famous food truck success stories is that of The Halal Guys, which started as a food cart in Manhattan and has since become a global franchise.
