In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health certificate. The health certificate ensures that the food truck meets specific health and safety standards set by local health authorities. This certification process involves inspections and compliance with food safety regulations, which are crucial to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure public health. The operator of the food truck must demonstrate that the vehicle is well-maintained, the food handling practices are safe, and that employees are adequately trained in food safety.

**Trivia:** Food trucks in Tokyo are often found at popular tourist spots and are known for their creative and diverse food offerings, ranging from traditional Japanese dishes to fusion and international cuisine.
