In Sydney's Central Business District (CBD), operating a food truck requires obtaining a specific permit from the local council, typically the City of Sydney. This permit ensures that all food trucks meet health, safety, and local government regulations, which are designed to protect public health and manage the city's public spaces effectively. Without this permit, a food truck operator risks significant fines and may be prohibited from conducting business in the area. The permit process involves several steps, including food safety certifications, proper vehicle inspections, and compliance with local zoning laws, which help maintain a structured and orderly environment in busy public spaces like Sydney's CBD.

**Trivia:** Sydney's food truck program was officially launched in 2012, and since then, it has grown to include a diverse range of cuisines, reflecting the city's multicultural population. The program was part of an initiative to enhance Sydney's street food scene and provide more late-night dining options in the city.
