In Toronto, whether you need a license to rent out a property depends on the type of rental activity you are engaged in. For long-term residential rentals, there is generally no requirement for a landlord to obtain a license. However, if you are renting out property on a short-term basis, such as through platforms like Airbnb, a license is required. The City of Toronto mandates that all short-term rental operators must register with the city and obtain a valid license. This regulation is aimed at ensuring that short-term rentals meet safety, zoning, and neighborhood compatibility standards. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in fines and other penalties.

**Trivia:** Toronto's regulations on short-term rentals were partially motivated by concerns over the impact of such rentals on the local housing market and the availability of long-term rental housing. The city aims to balance the economic benefits of tourism facilitated by short-term rentals with the needs of its residents.
