In the United Kingdom, including Birmingham, it is illegal to drive a vehicle on public roads without at least third-party car insurance. This requirement is mandated by the Road Traffic Act 1988. Third-party insurance is the minimum level of coverage that protects against damage or injury to others caused by the insured driver. Driving without such insurance is considered a serious offense and can result in penalties including fines, points on the driver's license, and potentially the impounding of the vehicle.

**Trivia:** The concept of car insurance dates back to the early 20th century. The UK's first car insurance policy was issued in 1896. Interestingly, the policy was acquired not because it was mandatory, but as a financial safety measure by the vehicle owner.
