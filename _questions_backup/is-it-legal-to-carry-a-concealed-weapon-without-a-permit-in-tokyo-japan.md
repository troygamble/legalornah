In Tokyo, Japan, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. Japan has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world. The possession, carrying, and use of firearms are heavily regulated by the Firearms and Swords Control Law. Individuals are generally prohibited from possessing firearms and swords, and the few exceptions that exist require stringent background checks, participation in training courses, and passing rigorous exams. Concealed carry permits are not typically available to the general public, and the concept of carrying concealed weapons as seen in some other countries is virtually non-existent in Japan.

**Trivia:** In Japan, even the possession of a pocket knife with a blade longer than 5.5 centimeters (about 2.2 inches) can be illegal under certain circumstances, reflecting the country's strict approach to weapons control.
