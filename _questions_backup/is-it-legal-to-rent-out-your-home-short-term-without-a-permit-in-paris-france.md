In Paris, France, the legality of renting out your home for short-term stays largely depends on whether the property is your primary residence and if specific regulations are met. Property owners are generally allowed to rent out their primary residence on a short-term basis for up to 120 days per year without a change of use permit. However, they must register with the city hall and obtain a registration number, which must be displayed on all rental listings. For non-primary residences, or if renting out beyond the 120-day limit, a change of use permit is required, converting the property's status from residential to commercial use. This process is often complex and involves compensating the city for the loss of residential space.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on short-term rentals, largely as a response to the housing shortage and the impact of platforms like Airbnb on the local housing market. The city has even deployed a special team to track and fine illegal rentals, which can result in significant penalties.
