In California, it is legal to smoke marijuana recreationally for adults aged 21 and over. This was made possible by the passage of Proposition 64, also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act, which was approved by voters in November 2016. Under this law, adults are allowed to possess, transport, purchase, consume, and share up to one ounce (28.5 grams) of marijuana and up to eight grams of concentrated marijuana. Additionally, individuals are permitted to cultivate up to six marijuana plants per residence for personal use, provided the cultivation area is locked and not visible from a public place.

**Trivia:** California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 with the passage of Proposition 215, also known as the Compassionate Use Act. This historic measure paved the way for broader marijuana legalization across the United States.
