In New York City, whether you need a business license to sell handmade goods can depend on various factors, including the type of goods you are selling and where you are selling them. Generally, selling handmade goods as a hobby without significant turnover might not require a business license. However, if this activity is conducted on a regular basis with the intent to make a profit, it likely qualifies as a business, necessitating a business license. Specific products might also require additional permits or licenses, such as food items, which must comply with health and safety regulations.

**Trivia:** Did you know that New York City has a special 'Made in NY' program that supports local manufacturers and goods producers? This initiative helps promote businesses that produce their products within the city.
