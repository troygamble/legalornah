Flying drones in London's public parks is subject to specific regulations and restrictions. Under UK law, drone operators must follow the rules set by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which includes not flying drones within 50 meters of people, vehicles, or buildings without their control. Additionally, many of London's public parks fall under the control of the Royal Parks, and they have their own regulations that prohibit the use of drones without prior permission. This means that while it is generally not allowed to fly drones in these parks, obtaining permission could make it legal in certain circumstances.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone was developed during World War I? However, it was not until the 21st century that drones became popular for both military and civilian uses, including photography and recreation.
