In Paris, as in the rest of France, it is illegal to sell food without a health inspection certificate. French food safety regulations, governed by both national laws and European Union directives, require that all establishments dealing with food preparation, storage, or sale undergo regular health inspections. These inspections ensure compliance with hygiene standards designed to protect public health. Businesses must receive a health inspection certificate that confirms their adherence to these standards before they can operate legally. Selling food without this certification can result in significant fines, closure of the business, and other legal penalties.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict food safety regulations, which contribute to its reputation as a global culinary capital. The city's oldest and most famous market, Le March√© des Enfants Rouges, established in 1628, adheres to these rigorous standards to offer a variety of high-quality foods.
