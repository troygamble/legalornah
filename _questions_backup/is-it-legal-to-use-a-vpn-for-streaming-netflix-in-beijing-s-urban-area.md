The legality of using a VPN to stream Netflix in Beijing's urban area is not straightforward and depends on various factors. While there is no explicit law that prohibits the use of VPNs in China, the government heavily regulates and controls the use of such services. The Chinese government requires all VPN providers to obtain a license from the government, and unauthorized VPN services are often blocked or considered illegal. For consumers, the situation is less clear, as there is no direct law that forbids individuals from using VPNs. However, using a VPN to access services like Netflix, which might involve bypassing regional restrictions, could be viewed as violating terms of service or engaging in bypassing state censorship mechanisms.

**Trivia:** Netflix is not officially available in China, and as such, many residents resort to using VPNs to access the streaming service. Interestingly, despite the restrictions, China has a vibrant online streaming market, with several local services such as iQiyi, Youku, and Tencent Video dominating the market.
