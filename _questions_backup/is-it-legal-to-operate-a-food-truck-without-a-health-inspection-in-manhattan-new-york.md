In Manhattan, New York, it is illegal to operate a food truck without undergoing a health inspection. The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene requires all food service establishments, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, to pass a health inspection to ensure they meet local sanitary codes. This process is crucial to ensure that the food served to the public is safe and the environment in which it is prepared and served adheres to health regulations. Food trucks must obtain a permit that is only issued after a successful inspection, and they are subject to regular inspections thereafter to maintain compliance.

**Trivia:** New York City is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering a variety of cuisines from around the world. In fact, the city hosts an annual event called the Vendy Awards, which is often referred to as the 'Oscars' of food trucks.
