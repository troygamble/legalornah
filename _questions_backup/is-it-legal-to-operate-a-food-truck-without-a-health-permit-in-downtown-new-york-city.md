In New York City, operating a food truck without a health permit is illegal. The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene requires all food service establishments, including mobile food vendors like food trucks, to have a valid permit to operate. This permit ensures that the food truck meets health and safety standards, which are crucial for protecting public health. The process of obtaining a permit involves several steps including submitting an application, undergoing a vehicle inspection, and paying relevant fees. Operating without this permit can result in significant fines, vehicle impoundment, and other legal consequences.

**Trivia:** New York City has one of the most vibrant food truck cultures in the United States, with hundreds of food trucks offering a diverse range of cuisines from around the world. In fact, the city hosts an annual event called the Vendy Awards, which is often referred to as the 'Oscars' of food trucks.
