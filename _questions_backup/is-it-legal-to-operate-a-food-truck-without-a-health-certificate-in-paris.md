In Paris, as in all of France, it is illegal to operate a food truck without a valid health certificate. This requirement is enforced to ensure that all food sold to the public meets safety and hygiene standards. The health certificate, often part of a broader set of permits including a 'permis de stationnement' (parking permit) specifically for food trucks, demonstrates that the operator has passed necessary health inspections and complies with the regulations set by the local health authorities, such as the Agence Régionale de Santé (ARS).

**Trivia:** Food trucks in Paris are a relatively recent phenomenon compared to their long history in cities like Los Angeles. They became popular in Paris around the early 2010s, introducing a new dynamic to the city's famed culinary landscape, often blending traditional French flavors with international street food styles.
