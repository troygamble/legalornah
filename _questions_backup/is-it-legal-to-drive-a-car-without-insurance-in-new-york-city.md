In New York City, as in the entire state of New York, it is illegal to drive a car without having active auto insurance. New York State requires all registered vehicles to carry a minimum level of liability insurance. This includes $25,000 for bodily injury per person, $50,000 for bodily injury per accident, and $10,000 for property damage per accident. The law mandates that the insurance must be issued in New York and provided by a company licensed by the NY State Department of Financial Services. Driving without insurance can lead to severe penalties including fines, the impoundment of your vehicle, and the suspension of your vehicle registration and driverâ€™s license.

**Trivia:** New York was the first state in the U.S. to require automobile liability insurance. This law came into effect in 1956, marking a significant step in the evolution of traffic law in the United States.
