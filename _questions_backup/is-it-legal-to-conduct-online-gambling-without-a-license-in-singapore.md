In Singapore, conducting online gambling without a license is illegal. The Remote Gambling Act, enacted in 2014, governs all forms of remote gambling activities, including internet and telephone betting. This law is very strict and explicitly prohibits any entity from offering or facilitating any form of online gambling services unless specifically authorized by the government. Licenses are tightly controlled and primarily granted to operators that can ensure responsible gambling practices and adhere to strict regulatory standards to prevent issues such as underage gambling and to address problem gambling behaviors.

**Trivia:** Singapore has one of the worldâ€™s lowest rates of problem gambling, partly due to its stringent regulations and active public awareness campaigns on the risks associated with gambling.
