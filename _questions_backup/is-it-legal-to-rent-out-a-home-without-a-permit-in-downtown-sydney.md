In downtown Sydney, the legality of renting out a home without a permit largely depends on the specific use of the property and local zoning laws. Generally, residential properties can be rented out, but if the property is being used for short-term rentals, such as those commonly listed on platforms like Airbnb, a permit may be required. The City of Sydney regulates short-term rental accommodations, requiring hosts to comply with specific planning controls and safety regulations. For long-term residential rentals, landlords must ensure that the property meets habitability standards and complies with the Residential Tenancies Act 2010, but a specific rental permit is not usually necessary.

**Trivia:** Sydney is known for its strict regulations on short-term rentals, which were tightened after concerns about housing affordability and the impact of transient guests on local communities. Interestingly, Sydney's iconic Opera House was once projected to cost $7 million and take four years to build, but it ended up costing $102 million and took 14 years.
