In Tokyo, Japan, it is generally necessary to register with local authorities before renting out an apartment on Airbnb due to regulations under the Minpaku Law, which governs private lodging services. This law, implemented in June 2018, requires hosts to obtain a license if they wish to rent out their properties for short-term stays. The regulation aims to ensure safety, minimize neighborhood disturbances, and maintain accommodation standards. Hosts must adhere to specific rules, such as limiting the rental days to 180 per year and ensuring proper management of the property.

**Trivia:** The Minpaku Law was introduced in response to Japan's increasing tourist numbers and the shortage of hotel rooms, especially highlighted during peak times like the Cherry Blossom season and large international events.
