In Arizona, it is legal for individuals who are at least 21 years old to carry a firearm openly or concealed without the need for a permit. This includes carrying a gun in a vehicle, either openly or concealed on one's person. However, there are certain places where carrying a firearm is prohibited, such as schools, government buildings, and establishments that serve alcohol and display a specific sign prohibiting firearms.

**Trivia:** Arizona is known for having some of the most lenient gun laws in the United States. It was one of the first states to allow the carrying of a concealed weapon without a permit.
