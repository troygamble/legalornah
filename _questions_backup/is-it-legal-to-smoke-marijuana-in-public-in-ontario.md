In Ontario, the legality of smoking marijuana in public spaces depends on several factors, primarily location-based restrictions. According to the Cannabis Act of 2018, which legalized recreational cannabis across Canada, provinces can set their own rules regarding where cannabis can be consumed. In Ontario, the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, 2017, stipulates that smoking cannabis is generally allowed where smoking tobacco is permitted. However, smoking marijuana is prohibited in enclosed public spaces, enclosed workplaces, and other designated areas such as schools, places where children gather, and within 9 meters of the entrance or exit of hospitals, psychiatric facilities, long-term care homes, and independent health facilities.

**Trivia:** Despite the legalization of cannabis in Canada, the first Canadian to legally purchase recreational cannabis (when it became legal at midnight) was in Newfoundland and Labrador, due to the time zone difference, making them the first in the country to make a legal purchase under the new law.
