In Bavaria, the legality of smoking in public places is governed by strict regulations that vary depending on the type of location. As of the latest updates, smoking is generally prohibited in all enclosed public spaces, including restaurants, bars, and public transportation, under the Bavarian Non-Smoker Protection Act. However, there are exceptions where establishments can designate specific smoking areas or rooms that are adequately ventilated and physically separated from non-smoking areas. Outdoor public spaces, such as streets and parks, typically do not have restrictions on smoking, unless specifically stated by local ordinances.

**Trivia:** Bavaria was one of the first states in Germany to implement strict non-smoking laws in public places, reflecting its strong cultural emphasis on health and cleanliness.
