In Île-de-France, the use of drones for photography is regulated by both national and local laws. France's national aviation authority, the Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), imposes regulations that require drone operators to adhere to specific rules depending on the drone’s weight and the nature of the flight. For instance, drones must generally be flown within the operator’s line of sight, during daylight hours, and at a maximum altitude of 150 meters. Additionally, there are no-fly zones, which include areas near airports and some public spaces, where drone operations are strictly prohibited without prior authorization. In Paris, which is part of Île-de-France, stricter regulations are in place due to the high density of historic monuments and government buildings. Special permissions are often required for drone flights in these sensitive areas.

**Trivia:** Did you know that France was one of the first countries to regulate the use of drones in civilian airspace? The French government has implemented comprehensive regulations to ensure safety and privacy, which have influenced drone laws in many other countries.
