In Paris, France, it is not legal to sell handmade cosmetics without obtaining the necessary approvals and complying with specific regulations. The European Union, which includes France, has stringent regulations under the EU Cosmetics Regulation (EC No. 1223/2009) that oversee the production and distribution of cosmetic products. This regulation mandates that all cosmetic products must undergo a safety assessment and be registered in the Cosmetic Products Notification Portal (CPNP) before they can be marketed. Each product must have a responsible person designated to ensure compliance with all EU cosmetic regulations, including safety, packaging, and labeling requirements.

**Trivia:** France is often considered the capital of the beauty industry, and it has been a leader in cosmetics since the 17th century when the use of makeup and perfumes became popular at the royal court of Louis XIV, known as the 'Sun King'.
