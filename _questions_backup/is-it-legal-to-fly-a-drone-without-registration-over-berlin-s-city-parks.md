In Germany, the legality of flying a drone without registration over Berlin's city parks depends on the weight and intended use of the drone. Drones weighing less than 250 grams do not require registration and can generally be flown in parks without special permissions. However, drones weighing more than 250 grams must be registered with the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (German Federal Aviation Office). Additionally, regardless of weight, drones are not allowed to fly over gatherings of people, which could include busy parks, and specific parks may have their own regulations prohibiting or restricting drone usage.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the Tiergarten, Berlin's largest and most popular park, was originally the hunting grounds for the Electors of Brandenburg? Today, it's a central location for recreation in the city, and the rules for drone flying here can be stricter due to the higher number of visitors and proximity to government buildings.
