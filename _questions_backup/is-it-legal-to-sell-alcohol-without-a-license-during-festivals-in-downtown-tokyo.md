In Japan, the sale of alcohol is regulated under the Liquor Tax Act and the Act on Securing of Liquor Tax and on Liquor Business Associations. According to these laws, any party selling alcohol must obtain a liquor license from the competent local authority, typically the prefectural government. This requirement applies universally, including during special events such as festivals. Selling alcohol without the appropriate license during a festival in downtown Tokyo, or anywhere in Japan, is illegal and can result in penalties including fines and imprisonment. The licensing process ensures that vendors meet certain standards that protect public health and safety, including the responsible serving of alcohol.

**Trivia:** In Japan, vending machines that sell beer and other alcoholic beverages are equipped with identification technology to verify the age of the purchaser, ensuring compliance with laws that prohibit the sale of alcohol to minors.
