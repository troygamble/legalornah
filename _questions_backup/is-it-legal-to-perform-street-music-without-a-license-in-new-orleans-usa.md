In New Orleans, the legality of performing street music without a license varies based on specific locations and the time of the performance. The city has designated certain areas as 'Free Expression and Performer Zones' where street performers can entertain without a permit. However, outside these zones, performers may need a permit or license, especially in high-traffic tourist areas like the French Quarter. Additionally, there are specific noise ordinances and time restrictions that govern when and how loud performances can be, which must be adhered to regardless of the location within the city.

**Trivia:** New Orleans is renowned for its rich musical heritage, often considered the birthplace of jazz. The city's street music scene is a vibrant part of its cultural allure, attracting musicians and performers from around the world.
