In New York City, operating a food truck without a health license is illegal. The city requires all food service establishments, including mobile food vendors such as food trucks, to obtain a permit from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). This permit ensures that the food truck meets health standards aimed at protecting public health. The process involves an inspection of the food truck to ensure compliance with food safety regulations, proper food handling, and cleanliness standards. Failing to have a valid health license can result in fines, the impoundment of the food truck, and other legal consequences.

**Trivia:** New York City is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering everything from gourmet meals and ethnic foods to classic street food. Food trucks in NYC have become a cultural phenomenon, often featured in travel and cuisine media.
