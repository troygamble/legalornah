In downtown Toronto, the legality of renting out a room without a permit largely depends on the specific circumstances and the local zoning laws. Generally, if you are renting out a room within your primary residence, you may not need a specific permit, but you must comply with the regulations set forth by the City of Toronto. These regulations include safety standards, the number of allowable occupants, and registration requirements if the arrangement qualifies as a short-term rental, typically under 28 consecutive days. For long-term rentals, different rules may apply, focusing more on landlord and tenant laws rather than short-term rental regulations.

**Trivia:** Toronto is known for its diverse population and vibrant housing market. Interestingly, the city's bylaws were adjusted to accommodate the growing trend of short-term rentals, influenced largely by platforms like Airbnb, which have significantly changed how residents and visitors perceive rental accommodations.
