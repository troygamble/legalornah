In Beijing, including the Chaoyang area, the legality of using a VPN for streaming or any other purpose is not straightforward. Chinese law strictly regulates the use of VPNs, requiring all VPN services to be licensed by the government. Unauthorized use of an unlicensed VPN to access censored content, including certain streaming services, can lead to legal repercussions. However, the enforcement of these regulations can vary, and some individuals and businesses may use VPNs without facing immediate consequences, especially if they are using them for non-subversive purposes.

**Trivia:** China's Great Firewall is one of the most sophisticated censorship systems in the world, blocking access to thousands of websites and services, including many popular international streaming platforms.
