In the United States, the legality of keeping a lion as a pet varies by state and sometimes even by local municipality. Some states outlaw the ownership of exotic pets entirely, while others require permits that are difficult to obtain. For instance, states like California and New York have strict exotic animal laws and do not allow lions as pets. Other states may allow it under stringent conditions, including acquiring a license, proving that adequate safety measures are in place, and sometimes needing to demonstrate experience in handling exotic animals.

**Trivia:** Did you know that in the early 20th century, it was not uncommon for Hollywood celebrities to keep exotic pets, including lions? One of the most famous was MGM Studios' mascot, Leo the Lion, who appeared in many films.
