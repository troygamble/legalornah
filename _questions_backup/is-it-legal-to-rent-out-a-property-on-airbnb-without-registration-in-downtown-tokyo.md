In downtown Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the legality of renting out a property on Airbnb without prior registration depends on compliance with the Minpaku Law, which was enforced starting June 15, 2018. This law requires anyone who wishes to operate a short-term rental, commonly referred to as 'minpaku', to register with the local government. The property must meet specific safety and health standards, and the owner must obtain a license. Additionally, there are restrictions on the number of days a property can be rented out, which is limited to 180 days per year. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines or other legal consequences.

**Trivia:** The Minpaku Law was introduced in response to the booming popularity of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb and the upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympics, to address concerns ranging from noise complaints to safety issues in residential areas.
