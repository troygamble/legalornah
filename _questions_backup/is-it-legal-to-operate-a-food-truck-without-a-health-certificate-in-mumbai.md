In Mumbai, as in other parts of India, operating a food truck or any food business requires adherence to certain health and safety regulations, which include obtaining a health certificate. This certificate is part of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) licensing, which ensures that the food truck meets specific guidelines pertaining to food safety and hygiene. The FSSAI license is mandatory for all food business operators in India, and it verifies that the food prepared, stored, and sold is safe for consumption. Operating without such a certificate can lead to significant legal consequences including fines and closure of the food business.

**Trivia:** The concept of food trucks, while popularized in the West, has seen a significant rise in India with Mumbai being one of the hotspots. These mobile eateries often gather at food truck parks, offering a variety of cuisines, which has become a popular trend among the city's younger population and office goers looking for quick gourmet options.
