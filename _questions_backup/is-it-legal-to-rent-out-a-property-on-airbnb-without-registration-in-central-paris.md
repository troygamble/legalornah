In central Paris, it is illegal to rent out a property on Airbnb without proper registration. Parisian regulations require homeowners who wish to rent out their properties as short-term rentals to register with the city. This registration process involves obtaining a unique registration number that must be displayed on all rental listings. The purpose of this regulation is to ensure compliance with local housing laws and to limit the number of days a property can be rented out in a year, which is capped at 120 days for primary residences. Failure to register and comply with these rules can lead to significant fines and penalties.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most popular cities on Airbnb, with thousands of listings available. The city's efforts to regulate short-term rentals through registration and other measures are partly aimed at preserving residential housing stock and maintaining the character of its neighborhoods.
