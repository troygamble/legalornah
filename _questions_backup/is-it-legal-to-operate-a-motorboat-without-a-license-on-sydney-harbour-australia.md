In Sydney Harbour, Australia, the legality of operating a motorboat without a license depends on the type of vessel and the operator's qualifications. According to New South Wales (NSW) regulations, any person who operates a powered vessel capable of traveling at 10 knots or more must possess a boat driving licence. This requirement ensures that operators are knowledgeable about navigation rules, safety procedures, and emergency protocols. The licensing process includes passing a knowledge test and, in some cases, a practical boating test. However, if the motorboat is incapable of reaching 10 knots, a license may not be necessary, but operators must still comply with all other maritime safety regulations.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is famous not only for its iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge but also for hosting one of the largest New Year's Eve fireworks displays in the world. The harbour sees a significant increase in boat traffic during this event, making understanding and compliance with local boating laws especially important for safety.
