In Tokyo, the legality of flying a drone in public parks depends on several factors including the specific park regulations and national aviation laws. According to Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau, drone operators generally need to obtain permission to fly drones in densely populated areas or near airports. Tokyo's public parks often fall under these restrictions due to their location within the city. Additionally, many parks in Tokyo have specific rules prohibiting or restricting drone use to prevent accidents and protect the privacy and safety of park visitors.

**Trivia:** In Japan, there are designated areas known as 'drone parks' where enthusiasts can fly their drones without the usual legal restrictions. These parks are specifically designed to cater to drone flying activities, providing a safe environment away from crowded public spaces.
