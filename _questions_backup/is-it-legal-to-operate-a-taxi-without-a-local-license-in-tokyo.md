In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, it is illegal to operate a taxi without a local license. The operation of taxis is regulated under the Road Transportation Act, which requires drivers to obtain a proper license specific to taxi services. This licensing system ensures that taxi drivers meet certain standards in terms of their driving ability, knowledge of the area, and the safety features of their vehicles. Additionally, taxi companies must also be registered and receive an operating license from the local government, which in Tokyo is managed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Bureau of Transportation.

**Trivia:** Tokyo is known for its distinctively colored taxis, with different colors denoting different taxi companies. This color-coding system helps residents and tourists distinguish between the myriad of taxi operators in the bustling metropolis.
