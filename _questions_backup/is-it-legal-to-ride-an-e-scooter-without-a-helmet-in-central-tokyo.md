In Tokyo, as well as throughout Japan, it is illegal to ride an e-scooter without wearing a helmet. E-scooters are classified under the same category as motorized bicycles under Japanese traffic law. This classification imposes several legal requirements on e-scooter riders, one of which is the mandatory use of helmets. The law is designed to ensure the safety of riders, as e-scooters can reach speeds that significantly increase the risk of serious injury in the event of an accident. Failure to comply with this regulation can lead to penalties including fines.

**Trivia:** Tokyo has seen a rise in the popularity of e-scooters, especially among commuters and tourists, leading to increased regulations to ensure public safety and order in traffic.
