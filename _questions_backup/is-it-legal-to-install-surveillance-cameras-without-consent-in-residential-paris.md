In Paris, as in the rest of France, the installation of surveillance cameras in residential areas is governed by strict privacy laws and regulations under the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL). The legality of installing surveillance cameras without consent in residential areas depends primarily on where the cameras are placed and whose privacy might be affected. Homeowners can install surveillance cameras around their property for security purposes, but they must ensure that the cameras do not invade the privacy of public areas or neighboring properties. This means cameras should not record public sidewalks, streets, or neighbors' properties without their consent. Additionally, if the surveillance is in a communal residential area, such as apartment buildings, the installation typically requires the agreement of the homeowners' association or a similar governing body.

**Trivia:** France's approach to privacy and personal data protection is considered one of the strictest in Europe. The country played a pivotal role in shaping the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has set the standard for privacy laws globally.
