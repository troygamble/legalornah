The legality of flying a drone in London without a permit depends on several factors including the weight of the drone, the area in which it is flown, and the purpose of the flight. Drones weighing less than 250 grams may generally be flown without a permit for recreational purposes, provided they are operated in a safe manner and do not invade privacy or cause disturbance. However, for drones weighing more than 250 grams, or for any drone used for commercial purposes, you must register with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and pass an online education test to receive a flyer ID. Additionally, specific flight restrictions apply near airports, in crowded areas, and near government buildings or other sensitive sites. It is crucial to check the latest CAA guidelines and local regulations before operating a drone in any part of London.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first unmanned, radio-controlled aircraft flight took place in 1935? The model, known as the 'Radioplane,' was developed primarily for military target practice, laying the groundwork for modern drone technology.
