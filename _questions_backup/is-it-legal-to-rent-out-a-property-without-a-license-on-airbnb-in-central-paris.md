In central Paris, the legality of renting out a property on Airbnb without a specific license depends on several factors, including the type of property and the duration of the rental. Parisian regulations require that any residential property rented out for short-term stays (less than 90 consecutive days) to tourists must be registered with the city. The owner must obtain a registration number that must be displayed on the listing. Furthermore, if the property is not the owner's primary residence, a commercial zoning permit might be required to legally rent it out for short stays. This is part of the city's effort to control the number of tourist accommodations and preserve residential housing stock.

**Trivia:** Paris is known for its strict regulations on short-term rentals, which were partly introduced in response to the housing shortage and to preserve the character of residential neighborhoods. The city has even deployed teams to track down illegal rentals, which can result in hefty fines for the owners.
