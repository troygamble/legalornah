In Tokyo, as in most parts of Japan, the legality of fishing without a license depends on the type of fishing and the specific location. For recreational fishing in coastal areas, a license is generally not required if you are fishing from the shore or a pier. However, if you plan to fish using a boat, or engage in specific types of fishing that might impact the fish population more significantly, such as commercial fishing, a license or permit is typically required. The regulations are enforced to manage fish stocks sustainably and ensure that marine ecosystems are protected from overfishing and other harmful practices.

**Trivia:** Tokyo Bay, a major body of water adjacent to the Tokyo metropolitan area, has a rich history and is known for its diverse marine life, making it a popular spot for both recreational and commercial fishing. Interestingly, the bay is also famous for its annual fireworks festival, which attracts thousands of spectators who enjoy the display from boats and the shoreline.
