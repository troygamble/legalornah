Flying a drone in New York City is subject to federal, state, and local regulations. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), any drone weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) and less than 55 pounds (approximately 25 kilograms) must be registered with the FAA. However, New York City imposes stricter regulations. The New York City Administrative Code generally prohibits the takeoff or landing of drones within the city limits except at designated areas approved by the FAA or the city itself. This means that in most cases, flying a drone in New York City without specific approval is illegal. Furthermore, areas like parks may have additional restrictions imposed by the Parks Department.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first recorded use of a drone for warfare took place in 1849 when the Austrian Empire attacked Venice with unmanned balloons loaded with explosives?
