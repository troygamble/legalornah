In Sydney, as in all parts of New South Wales and indeed Australia, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without having at least Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance, also known as 'Green Slip' insurance. This type of insurance is mandatory and provides coverage for any person you might injure while driving your car, including pedestrians, cyclists, and other drivers. Driving without CTP insurance is a serious offence and can result in heavy fines, demerit points, and potentially the suspension of your driver's license.

**Trivia:** Australia was one of the first countries to introduce compulsory car insurance. The state of Victoria led the way with legislation enacted as early as the 1920s.
