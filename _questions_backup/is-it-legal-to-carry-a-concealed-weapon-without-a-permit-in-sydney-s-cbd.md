In Sydney, as in the rest of New South Wales and Australia, it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon without the appropriate permit. Australian laws are very strict regarding the possession and carrying of weapons, especially firearms. The Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 (NSW) and the Firearms Act 1996 (NSW) are key legislations that regulate the use of such items. Under these laws, individuals must have a valid reason and a corresponding permit to legally carry or possess a weapon. Concealed carry of weapons, particularly firearms, is generally restricted to law enforcement and other specially authorized personnel.

**Trivia:** Australia's strict gun laws were largely a result of the 1996 Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania, where 35 people were killed. This led to the introduction of tightened gun control laws known as the National Firearms Agreement.
