In Japan, the legality of flying a drone, especially in densely populated areas such as central Tokyo, depends on several factors including the size of the drone and the specific location. According to Japan's Civil Aviation Bureau, drones weighing more than 200 grams require the operator to register and follow specific aviation laws. These laws include not flying drones near airports, over crowded areas, or at altitudes higher than 150 meters without special permission. Central Tokyo, being a highly populated area, has additional restrictions, particularly near government buildings, historical sites, and parks.

**Trivia:** In 2015, a drone carrying radioactive material landed on the roof of the Japanese Prime Minister's office, leading to stricter drone regulations in Japan.
