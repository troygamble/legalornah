In Sydney, the legality of selling products online without a business license depends on several factors, including the type of products being sold and the scale of the business. Generally, small-scale or casual sellers, such as individuals selling personal items occasionally, do not need a business license. However, if the online sales are regular and operate as a business, obtaining a business license is often required. This includes businesses selling goods or services that are taxable under Australian law. The City of Sydney stipulates that business licenses are necessary for commercial activities to ensure compliance with local regulations and tax obligations.

**Trivia:** Sydney is known for its vibrant market scene, and the city's regulations are designed to keep the market fair and competitive. Interestingly, Sydney was one of the first cities in Australia to adopt comprehensive e-commerce regulations, reflecting its forward-thinking approach to technology and business.
