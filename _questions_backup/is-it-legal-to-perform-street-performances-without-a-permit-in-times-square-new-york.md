In Times Square, New York, the legality of performing street performances without a permit depends on the nature and specifics of the performance. Generally, New York City allows artistic performances in public spaces under the protection of the First Amendment. However, there are regulations that performers must follow, particularly in busy areas like Times Square. Performers are often required to avoid blocking pedestrian traffic and may not use amplified sound without a permit. The city's rules are designed to balance the performers' rights to express themselves with the public's right to use sidewalks and public areas without undue interference.

**Trivia:** Times Square is one of the most heavily trafficked public spaces in the world, with pedestrian counts exceeding 300,000 people on its busiest days. This area has been a popular spot for street performers and artists, ranging from musicians and dancers to living statues and caricature artists, each adding a unique flavor to the vibrant cultural mosaic of New York City.
