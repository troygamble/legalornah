In New York, the legality of recording a phone call depends on the consent of the parties involved. New York is a 'one-party consent' state, which means that only one party involved in the conversation needs to be aware of and consent to the recording. This implies that if you are a participant in the conversation, you can legally record the phone call without needing to inform the other party. However, it is illegal to record conversations that you are not a part of without the consent of at least one of the involved parties.

**Trivia:** The one-party consent law in New York makes it a popular jurisdiction for journalists and private investigators, as they can record their own conversations with sources or subjects without needing additional consent.
