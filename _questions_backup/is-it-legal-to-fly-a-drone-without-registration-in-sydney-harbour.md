In Sydney Harbour, the legality of flying a drone without registration depends on the type and weight of the drone as well as its intended use. According to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) in Australia, drones weighing more than 250 grams must be registered before they can be flown outdoors. This registration process involves providing details about the drone and the operator, and it is designed to ensure safety and accountability in airspace usage. Additionally, flying drones in certain areas of Sydney Harbour may be restricted or prohibited, especially near airports, helipads, or areas designated for environmental protection or national security.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is not only a popular location for drone photography due to its stunning views but is also frequently monitored for safety and security, especially during large public events such as New Year's Eve fireworks.
