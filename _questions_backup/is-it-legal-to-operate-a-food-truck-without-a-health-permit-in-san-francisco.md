In San Francisco, it is illegal to operate a food truck without obtaining a health permit. The city requires all mobile food facilities, including food trucks, to comply with the Department of Public Health's regulations to ensure food safety and public health. Obtaining a health permit involves submitting an application, undergoing inspections, and adhering to specific health codes, which include proper food handling, storage, and preparation practices. This permit ensures that the food served to the public meets safety standards and protects consumers from health risks associated with improperly handled food.

**Trivia:** San Francisco is known for its diverse and vibrant food truck scene, often featured in various food festivals and events across the city, offering a wide range of cuisines from around the world.
