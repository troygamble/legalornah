Flying a drone in Sydney Harbour without prior approval is generally not legal due to specific airspace restrictions and regulations governing drone use in the area. Sydney Harbour is classified as a sensitive area due to its proximity to key landmarks and infrastructure, including the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) regulates drone flying under the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998 (CASR Part 101), which stipulates that operators must not fly drones in populous areas or near major public infrastructures without appropriate approvals or exemptions. Additionally, drone operators need to ensure they are not flying within restricted airspace, which often covers significant parts of Sydney Harbour.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is not only a no-fly zone for drones without permission, but it is also a location where the New Year's Eve fireworks are famously displayed, attracting viewers from all around the world. The airspace restrictions are particularly strict during such high-profile events to ensure safety and security.
