The legality of using a VPN to stream Netflix in Beijing is a complex issue, primarily due to the regulations imposed by the Chinese government on the use of VPNs. In China, the use of VPNs is heavily regulated and generally restricted to those that are government-approved. Most international VPN services are blocked, and the use of an unauthorized VPN can lead to legal consequences. However, if a VPN is approved by the Chinese government, technically it could be used legally, though such VPNs may not effectively bypass geo-restrictions imposed by services like Netflix.

**Trivia:** Netflix is not officially available in China. Instead, Netflix has licensing agreements with local Chinese companies like iQiyi, where some Netflix original content can be watched legally within the country.
