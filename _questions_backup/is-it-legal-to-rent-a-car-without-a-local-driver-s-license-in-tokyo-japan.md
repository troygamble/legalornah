In Tokyo, Japan, it is not generally permissible to rent a car using only a foreign driver's license. Visitors who wish to rent a car must have either a Japanese driver's license or an International Driving Permit (IDP) that is recognized by Japan, along with their valid foreign driver's license. The IDP must be obtained in the visitor's home country before arriving in Japan, and it must conform to the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic. Additionally, some rental agencies may require a translation of the foreign driver's license if it is not in English or Japanese, particularly if the license does not include a photograph of the holder.

**Trivia:** Did you know that in Japan, vehicles drive on the left side of the road? This tradition dates back to the Edo period (1603-1868) when samurai walked on the left side to avoid clashing their swords with those coming from the opposite direction.
