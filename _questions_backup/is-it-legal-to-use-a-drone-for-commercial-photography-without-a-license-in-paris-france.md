In Paris, France, using a drone for commercial photography without a license is illegal. French regulations require that any commercial drone operation must obtain a specific license from the French civil aviation authority (Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile, DGAC). This includes operations for photography and filming. The regulations are strict due to concerns over privacy, security, and safety, especially in densely populated areas like Paris. Drone operators must also ensure they comply with no-fly zones, which cover many parts of the city, including tourist hotspots and government buildings.

**Trivia:** France was one of the first countries to regulate the use of drones in the national airspace, establishing rules as early as 2012. Paris, known for its historical and cultural significance, has additional restrictions to protect its landmarks and ensure the safety and privacy of its residents and many visitors.
