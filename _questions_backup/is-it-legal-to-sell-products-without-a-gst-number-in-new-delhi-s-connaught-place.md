In New Delhi, as in the rest of India, the requirement to have a Goods and Services Tax (GST) number for selling products depends on the nature and scale of the business. According to the GST Act of 2017, businesses with an annual turnover exceeding Rs 40 lakhs (Rs 20 lakhs for special category states) are required to register for GST and possess a GST number. This threshold is indicative of the business's scale and its tax obligations under the law. For businesses operating below this threshold, registering for GST is not mandatory, but they may choose to register voluntarily. This allows them to claim input tax credit and be part of the formal tax system, enhancing their credibility with business partners.

**Trivia:** Connaught Place, often referred to as CP, is one of the largest financial, commercial, and business centers in New Delhi. It was named after the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn and was designed by British architects Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker. CP is a prime example of the Georgian architecture style and was developed as a showpiece of Lutyen's Delhi with a prominent place in the city's urban heritage.
