In New York City, carrying a concealed weapon without proper registration and licensing is illegal. The state of New York requires individuals to obtain a license to legally carry a concealed firearm, and this process includes meeting specific criteria such as background checks and safety training courses. New York City has even stricter regulations and typically does not recognize concealed carry permits from other counties within New York or from other states. The law is very strict in high-security areas like Times Square, where the presence of a concealed weapon without proper authorization can lead to significant legal consequences, including arrest and prosecution.

**Trivia:** Times Square is not only a major commercial and entertainment hub but also a high-security area, especially during large events like New Year's Eve celebrations. The area is often under heavy surveillance and has a significant police presence to ensure public safety.
