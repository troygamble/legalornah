In Toronto, operating a food truck without a health certificate is illegal. The City of Toronto mandates that all food truck operators must obtain a valid health certificate from Toronto Public Health. This certificate ensures that the food truck meets health and safety standards, which are crucial for protecting public health. The process involves inspections that check for proper food handling, storage, and preparation practices, along with the cleanliness and maintenance of the food truck itself.

**Trivia:** Food trucks in Toronto have grown in popularity and diversity, often featured at various festivals and events around the city. The city even hosts annual food truck festivals that attract both locals and tourists, showcasing a wide range of cuisines.
