The legality of using a metal detector in Cornwall without a permit depends on the location where the metal detecting is being conducted. In general, metal detecting on private land requires the landowner's permission. Without this permission, metal detecting is illegal and can be considered trespassing. For public lands, the rules can vary. Some areas, particularly those with historical or archaeological significance, may require a permit or may be completely off-limits for metal detecting. It is also important to note that removing artifacts from public lands without a license is illegal under the Treasure Act 1996 and the Portable Antiquities Scheme in England and Wales.

**Trivia:** Cornwall has a rich history of mining and has been a hotspot for treasure hunters. The region is known for its historical shipwrecks and buried treasures, which makes it a particularly appealing area for metal detecting enthusiasts.
