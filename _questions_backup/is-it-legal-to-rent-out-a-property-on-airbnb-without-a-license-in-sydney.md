In Sydney, the legality of renting out a property on Airbnb without a license depends on several factors, including the local council regulations and the specific zoning rules of the area where the property is located. As of recent updates, the New South Wales (NSW) government has implemented state-wide regulations that allow homeowners to rent out their primary residence on short-term rental platforms like Airbnb for up to 180 days per year in Greater Sydney, without needing a specific license. However, if the property is not a primary residence or is located outside of these areas, different rules may apply. Additionally, strata (condominium) committees may have their own regulations that could restrict or prohibit short-term rentals.

**Trivia:** Airbnb was founded in 2008 when two hosts rented out air mattresses in their living room and provided a homemade breakfast for their guests. This simple concept has since transformed into a global phenomenon, impacting hotel markets and residential leasing practices worldwide.
