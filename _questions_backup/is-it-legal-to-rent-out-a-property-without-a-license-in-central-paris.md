In central Paris, the legality of renting out a property without a license primarily depends on the type of rental and the duration. For short-term rentals, particularly those less than 120 days per year, the property owner must register the property with the city hall and obtain a registration number. This rule is specifically stringent if the property is not the owner's primary residence. For long-term rentals, the regulations are less strict regarding licensing, but compliance with national and local housing regulations is mandatory. The purpose of these regulations is to maintain a balance in the housing market, prevent shortages, and ensure that residential properties are not used predominantly for short-term tourist accommodations without proper oversight.

**Trivia:** Paris has implemented these strict rental regulations partly in response to the city's housing crisis, which has been exacerbated by the popularity of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb. These platforms have significantly increased the number of tourists staying in residential areas, leading to concerns about the availability of affordable housing for locals.
