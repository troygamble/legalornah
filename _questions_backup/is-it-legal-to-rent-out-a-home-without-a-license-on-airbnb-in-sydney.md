In Sydney, whether you can rent out a home on Airbnb without a license depends on several factors, including the type of property and the duration of the rental. New South Wales (NSW) laws, particularly those enacted in 2018, regulate short-term rental accommodation. Homeowners are allowed to rent out their primary residences on platforms like Airbnb for up to 180 days per year without needing a special license. However, if the property is not the owner's primary residence, different rules apply, and a planning approval may be required from the local council. Additionally, strata-titled buildings can pass by-laws that restrict or prohibit short-term rentals altogether.

**Trivia:** Airbnb was founded in 2008 when two hosts rented out air mattresses in their living room. The concept has since revolutionized the way people think about lodging worldwide, including in Sydney, which is one of the top destinations for Airbnb users.
