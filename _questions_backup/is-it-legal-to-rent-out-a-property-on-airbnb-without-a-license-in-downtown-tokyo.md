In downtown Tokyo, the legality of renting out a property on Airbnb without a license depends on several factors, including the type of property and the duration of the stay. Japan's national government passed the Private Lodging Business Act (Minpaku Law) in 2018, which requires hosts to register their property with local authorities and obtain a license if they wish to rent out their homes for short-term stays. This law was implemented to regulate the booming market of short-term rentals and address concerns such as safety and neighborhood disturbances. Under this law, properties can be rented out for up to 180 days per year, provided the hosts comply with local regulations, which may vary between different wards in Tokyo.

**Trivia:** The Minpaku Law was partly introduced in response to the anticipated influx of tourists for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, aiming to increase accommodation capacity while ensuring residential peace and safety.
