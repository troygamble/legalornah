In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the legality of flying a drone without a license depends on several factors including the size of the drone and its use. Drones weighing more than 200 grams require registration with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT). Furthermore, specific rules apply depending on where and how you intend to fly the drone. For example, flying drones in densely populated areas or near airports without prior permission is prohibited. Additionally, drone operators are generally required to follow safety guidelines such as maintaining a certain distance from people and buildings and avoiding restricted areas.

**Trivia:** In Tokyo, there's an annual event known as the 'New Year Drone Countdown,' where hundreds of drones are used to create spectacular light shows as part of the New Year celebrations.
