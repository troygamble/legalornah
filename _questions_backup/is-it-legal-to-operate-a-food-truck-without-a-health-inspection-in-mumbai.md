In Mumbai, as in other parts of India, operating a food truck or any food business requires adherence to certain health and safety regulations mandated by local and national laws. The primary regulation that governs this is the Food Safety and Standards Act (FSSA) of 2006, which is enforced by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). According to this act, every food business operator, including food trucks, must register with the FSSAI and obtain a valid food license. This license is granted only after the food business has been inspected and is found to comply with the safety and hygiene standards set forth by the authority.

**Trivia:** Mumbai's street food culture is renowned globally, and the city is especially famous for its 'vada pav' and 'bhel puri'. Food trucks in Mumbai add a modern twist to this vibrant street food scene, offering everything from gourmet sandwiches to fusion cuisines.
