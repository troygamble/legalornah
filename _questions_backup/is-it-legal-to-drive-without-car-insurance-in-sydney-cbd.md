In Sydney CBD, as in all parts of New South Wales (NSW) and Australia, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without having at least compulsory third party (CTP) insurance. This type of insurance, also known as 'Green Slip' in NSW, covers the cost of compensation claims if you injure or kill someone in a motor vehicle accident. Driving without this minimum level of insurance can result in severe penalties including fines, demerit points, and potentially the suspension of your driver's license. Furthermore, if an uninsured driver is involved in an accident, they could be held personally liable for significant financial costs arising from any injuries caused.

**Trivia:** The term 'Green Slip' is unique to NSW and derives from the original color of the form used for this insurance. While other states in Australia use different terms and systems, the requirement for compulsory third party insurance is a nationwide standard.
