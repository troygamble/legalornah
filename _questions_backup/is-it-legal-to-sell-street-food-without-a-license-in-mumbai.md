In Mumbai, it is not legal to sell street food without a proper license. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) requires all street food vendors to obtain a license under the Shop and Establishment Act. This regulation ensures that all food sold to the public meets health and safety standards to prevent issues such as food poisoning and unsanitary conditions. The licensing process involves inspections and adherence to specific guidelines, including hygiene practices and proper waste disposal.

**Trivia:** Mumbai is famous for its vibrant street food culture, with local specialties like Vada Pav and Pav Bhaji being popular among both residents and tourists. The city's street food vendors are an integral part of Mumbai's bustling urban landscape, contributing significantly to its economy and cultural identity.
