In downtown New York City, operating a food truck without a health certificate is illegal. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) mandates that all mobile food vendors, including food trucks, obtain a valid health certificate and a mobile food vending permit. These regulations ensure that the food served to the public meets safety standards, which helps in preventing foodborne illnesses. The health certificate is proof that the vendor has undergone and passed the necessary food safety training, and the permit confirms that the food truck has been inspected and meets the specific health and safety guidelines set by the city.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the concept of mobile food vending in New York dates back to the 17th century when street vendors sold oysters and clams from carts? Today, food trucks offer a wide variety of gourmet and ethnic foods, reflecting New York City's diverse culinary culture.
