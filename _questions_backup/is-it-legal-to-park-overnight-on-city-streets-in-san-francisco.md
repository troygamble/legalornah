In San Francisco, the legality of parking overnight on city streets depends on the specific location and the signage that regulates parking in that area. Many streets in San Francisco have parking restrictions that are clearly marked with signs indicating when parking is allowed and when it is prohibited. These restrictions may include street cleaning times, residential permit requirements, or time limits. It is important for drivers to carefully check the posted signs to determine if overnight parking is permitted in a particular spot.

**Trivia:** San Francisco is known for its steep hills, some of which have become famous through movies and photographs. Parking on these hills requires drivers to curb their wheels to prevent the car from rolling down in case of a brake failure, which is also regulated by city parking laws.
