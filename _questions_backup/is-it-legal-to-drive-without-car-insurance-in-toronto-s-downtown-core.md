In Toronto, as well as the rest of Ontario, it is illegal to operate a vehicle without car insurance. The law requires that all motorists carry a minimum level of car insurance before they can legally drive a vehicle on public roads. This mandatory insurance includes third-party liability coverage, which protects drivers in the event that they cause injury or damage to another person or their property while driving. Failure to have this insurance can result in severe penalties including fines, vehicle impoundment, and the suspension of driving privileges.

**Trivia:** Toronto is known for its diverse range of drivers and vehicles, including the largest number of electric cars in Canada. Despite this diversity, the requirement for mandatory car insurance applies universally across all types of vehicles.
