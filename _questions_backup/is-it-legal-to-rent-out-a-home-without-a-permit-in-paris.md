In Paris, whether you can rent out a home without a permit depends primarily on the duration of the rental and the type of property being rented. For short-term rentals, specifically those less than 120 days per year, homeowners must register the property with the city authorities to obtain a registration number, which must be displayed on all rental listings. This regulation is particularly strict due to concerns about housing availability and the impact of platforms like Airbnb on the local housing market. For long-term rentals, generally longer than a year, such registration is not required, but landlords must comply with other regulations concerning rental agreements, safety standards, and tenant rights.

**Trivia:** Paris introduced these stringent regulations on short-term rentals partly because of the significant impact on its housing market, with some central areas experiencing a decrease in permanent residents as properties are turned into lucrative short-term rental units.
