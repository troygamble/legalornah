In Sydney's Central Business District (CBD), it is illegal to operate a food truck without a proper permit. The City of Sydney regulates the operation of food trucks under its Food Truck Program, which requires potential operators to apply for and obtain a specific food truck permit. This permit system ensures that food trucks meet health, safety, and operational standards set by the local government. The process includes inspections and approval of the truck itself, the food handling practices, and the specific locations where the truck will operate.

**Trivia:** Sydney's food truck scene has grown significantly in recent years, influenced by trends from cities like Los Angeles and New York where food truck culture is a vibrant part of urban life. Sydney's food trucks often gather at popular events and locations, adding a diverse culinary flair to the city's dining options.
