In Australia, the legality of flying a drone over Sydney Harbour without registration depends on the weight of the drone and its intended use. Drones weighing more than 250 grams must be registered with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) before they can be legally flown. For recreational use, drones must also adhere to certain safety rules, such as not flying in populous areas or near other aircraft, which makes flying over Sydney Harbour generally restricted. Additionally, Sydney Harbour is classified as a sensitive area due to its proximity to Sydney Airport and its status as a national landmark, imposing stricter controls on drone activities.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is not only famous for its stunning views but also hosts one of the worldâ€™s largest natural harbours. It is also home to the iconic Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge, making it a highly monitored and regulated area for activities such as drone flying.
