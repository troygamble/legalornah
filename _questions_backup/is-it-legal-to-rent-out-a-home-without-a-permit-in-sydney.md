In Sydney, the legality of renting out a home without a permit largely depends on the type of rental and the specific local government area regulations. For short-term holiday rentals, such as those commonly listed on platforms like Airbnb, the New South Wales government has established state-wide regulations that may require the owner to register the property and adhere to certain rules, but not necessarily obtain a traditional permit. However, for long-term rentals, local councils might have specific requirements regarding registration or approval processes to ensure that the property meets safety and zoning standards. It is crucial for property owners to check with their local council to understand the specific requirements applicable to their property and rental intentions.

**Trivia:** Sydney, known for its vibrant housing market, was one of the first cities in Australia to introduce regulations specifically addressing short-term rental accommodations, reflecting its popularity as a tourist destination.
