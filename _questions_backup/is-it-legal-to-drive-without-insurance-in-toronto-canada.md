In Toronto, as in all of Ontario, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without proper car insurance. Under the Ontario Highway Traffic Act, every motorist must have at least a standard insurance policy, which includes third-party liability, statutory accident benefits, direct compensation-property damage coverage, and uninsured automobile coverage. Driving without insurance can lead to severe penalties including fines ranging from $5,000 to $50,000, possible suspension of your driverâ€™s license, and even impoundment of your vehicle.

**Trivia:** Interestingly, Ontario has one of the highest car insurance rates in Canada, which is partly due to the high level of coverage that is mandated by the law.
