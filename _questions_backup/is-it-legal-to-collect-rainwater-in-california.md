In California, it is legal to collect rainwater falling on your property for personal use. This practice is encouraged as a way to conserve water and reduce runoff. The state passed the Rainwater Capture Act of 2012, which explicitly allows the capture and use of rainwater collected from rooftops. However, there are some guidelines to ensure that the collected water is used safely and does not contribute to contamination or misuse. For example, systems designed to collect and store rainwater should be properly maintained to prevent breeding grounds for mosquitoes and other pests.

**Trivia:** California's encouragement of rainwater collection is part of a larger effort to address the state's frequent drought conditions. By capturing rainwater, residents can reduce their reliance on local water supplies, which are often strained during dry periods.
