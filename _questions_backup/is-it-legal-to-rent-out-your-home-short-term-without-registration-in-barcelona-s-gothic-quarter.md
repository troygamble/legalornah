In Barcelona, particularly in the Gothic Quarter and other central areas, it is not legal to rent out your home on a short-term basis without proper registration. The city has specific regulations aimed at controlling short-term rentals to manage tourism and protect local housing markets. Homeowners must obtain a license to operate short-term rental properties, which involves ensuring the property meets certain standards and adheres to local zoning laws. The process is part of an effort to reduce the impact of short-term rentals on the availability and affordability of housing for residents.

**Trivia:** Barcelona introduced these stringent regulations after experiencing a surge in tourism, which led to rising rental prices and concerns over the preservation of local communities, especially in historic areas like the Gothic Quarter.
