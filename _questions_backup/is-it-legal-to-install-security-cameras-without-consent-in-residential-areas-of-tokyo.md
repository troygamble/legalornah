In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the legality of installing security cameras without consent in residential areas depends on various factors, including the location of the cameras and the scope of their coverage. Japanese law, particularly the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI), mandates that any collection of personal data must respect individuals' privacy rights. Installing cameras that capture images of public areas or neighboring properties can be considered a breach of privacy if done without the consent of those captured on camera. Furthermore, the installation should not violate any local housing laws or regulations, which might have specific clauses about surveillance and privacy.

**Trivia:** Japan has one of the highest numbers of vending machines per capita in the world, including many with built-in cameras for security and operational purposes. These cameras help in monitoring transactions and preventing theft.
