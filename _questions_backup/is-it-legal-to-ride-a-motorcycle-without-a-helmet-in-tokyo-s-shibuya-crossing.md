In Japan, it is mandatory for all motorcycle riders and passengers to wear helmets while riding on public roads, including Tokyo's Shibuya crossing. This requirement is enforced under Japan's Road Traffic Act, which aims to protect the safety of motorcyclists and reduce the risk of injuries in accidents. The law specifically states that both drivers and passengers must wear helmets that meet safety standards approved by the Japanese government. Failure to comply with this law can result in penalties, including fines and points on the driver's license.

**Trivia:** Shibuya crossing, also known as 'Shibuya Scramble,' is famous for being one of the busiest pedestrian crossings in the world, where up to 3,000 people cross at the same time during peak hours.
