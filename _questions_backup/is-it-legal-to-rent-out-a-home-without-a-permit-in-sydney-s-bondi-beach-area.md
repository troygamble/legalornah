In Sydney, including the Bondi Beach area, the legality of renting out a home without a permit primarily depends on the type of rental and the duration for which the property is being rented. For short-term rentals, such as holiday accommodations, specific regulations may apply. For instance, New South Wales (NSW) has rules that limit short-term holiday lettings in certain areas unless specific conditions are met, which may include obtaining a permit or adhering to local council regulations. These rules are intended to manage the impact of short-term rentals on local communities. For long-term rentals, different regulations apply, usually focusing on tenant rights and property standards rather than the need for a specific rental permit. However, landlords must ensure the property is registered and meets all health and safety standards as required by local laws.

**Trivia:** Bondi Beach is not only famous for its stunning views and surf but also for being a hotspot for real estate investments, including rental properties. The area's popularity has prompted local authorities to implement specific regulations to balance the residential needs with the influx of tourists.
