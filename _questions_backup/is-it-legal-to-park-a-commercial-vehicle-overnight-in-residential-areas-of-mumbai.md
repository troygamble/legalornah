In Mumbai, the legality of parking a commercial vehicle overnight in residential areas largely depends on local regulations and the specific rules set by municipal authorities. The Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act and traffic regulations generally discourage the parking of heavy commercial vehicles in residential zones to reduce congestion and maintain public safety. However, permissions and exceptions might exist based on the size of the vehicle, the nature of the business, and specific local by-laws. For instance, smaller commercial vehicles used for local deliveries might have different regulations compared to larger trucks or buses.

**Trivia:** Mumbai, despite its vast size and population, has relatively fewer parking spaces per vehicle compared to other major cities in the world, which leads to innovative solutions and strict parking regulations.
