In Sydney's Bondi Beach, the legality of flying a drone without a license depends on the type of drone and its intended use. For recreational purposes, drones weighing under 2 kilograms can generally be flown without a license, provided they adhere to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) safety rules. These rules include not flying the drone higher than 120 meters, keeping it within visual line-of-sight, and not flying over populous areas such as beaches or parks where people are gathered. However, for commercial purposes or for drones weighing over 2 kilograms, a license or certification from CASA is required. Additionally, specific areas may have local restrictions or no-fly zones, which must also be respected.

**Trivia:** Bondi Beach is not only famous for its scenic views but also for being a highly monitored area for drone activity, especially during major events like the annual Sculpture by the Sea exhibition, where drone usage is typically restricted to protect the artworks and visitors.
