In Paris, France, the legality of renting out your home on a short-term basis without a license depends on several factors, including the duration of the rental and the type of property. According to French law, specifically the ALUR Act and local regulations, homeowners in Paris who wish to rent out their primary residence for short periods (less than 120 days a year) are allowed to do so without a special license. However, if the property is not the owner's primary residence, or if it is rented out for more than 120 days in a year, a commercial license is required. This regulation aims to control the local housing market and prevent shortages caused by the proliferation of short-term tourist rentals.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most visited cities in the world, and its regulations on short-term rentals were partly introduced to preserve residential housing availability in the face of growing tourism. The city has taken active steps, including implementing a registration system for short-term rental properties to track and enforce these regulations.
