In France, the use of drones, especially in highly populated areas and near significant landmarks such as those in Paris, is tightly regulated by the French Civil Aviation Authority (Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile, DGAC). Drones must be registered with the DGAC if they weigh more than 800 grams. Moreover, flying drones over Paris is generally prohibited without specific authorization, regardless of the drone's weight. This restriction includes all Parisian landmarks, which are often in restricted zones due to their cultural importance and the high density of tourists. Violating these regulations can lead to significant fines and other legal consequences.

**Trivia:** Did you know that in 2018, Paris hosted an official drone racing event, the 'Paris Drone Festival', where drones raced along the Champs-Elysées? This event was one of the few instances where drones were publicly flown in Paris under strict regulatory oversight.
