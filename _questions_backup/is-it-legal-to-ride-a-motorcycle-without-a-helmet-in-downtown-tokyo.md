In Tokyo, as well as throughout Japan, it is mandatory for all motorcycle riders and their passengers to wear helmets. This regulation is enforced under Japan's Road Traffic Act, which aims to ensure the safety of both riders and other road users. The law specifies that the helmets must meet certain safety standards to be considered valid. Failure to comply with this law can result in penalties including fines and points on the driver's license, emphasizing the seriousness with which these safety regulations are enforced.

**Trivia:** Japan was one of the first countries in Asia to implement strict motorcycle helmet laws, which have significantly contributed to reducing fatalities and injuries associated with motorcycle accidents.
