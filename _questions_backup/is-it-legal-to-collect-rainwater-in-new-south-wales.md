In New South Wales (NSW), it is generally legal to collect rainwater, primarily for residential use. Homeowners are encouraged to install rainwater tanks to gather and store rainwater for purposes such as gardening, washing, and even for plumbing needs inside the house. The NSW Government supports the use of rainwater tanks as part of sustainable living practices and to reduce demand on public water supplies. However, the installation and use of rainwater tanks must comply with local council regulations and building codes, which can vary depending on the specific area. These regulations may dictate the size, placement, and maintenance of rainwater tanks, as well as how the water can be used.

**Trivia:** Sydney, the capital city of New South Wales, was once heavily reliant on rainwater collected in tanks during the early colonial days before the development of modern water supply systems.
