In Sydney, the legality of renting out a home without a rental license primarily depends on the type of property and the purpose of the rental. For standard residential properties, New South Wales (NSW) law does not generally require a specific 'rental license.' Landlords must ensure the property is habitable and meets specific safety standards, and they are required to register the property with the NSW Rental Bond Board. However, if the property is being rented out as a short-term holiday rental, different rules may apply. For instance, Sydney has specific regulations governing short-term rental accommodations, which might require approval or compliance with local council regulations.

**Trivia:** Sydney is known for its vibrant property market and has one of the highest rates of rental households in Australia, making it a hotspot for real estate investments and rental activities.
