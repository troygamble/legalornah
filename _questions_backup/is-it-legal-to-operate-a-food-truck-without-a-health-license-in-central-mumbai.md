In Mumbai, as in most cities in India, operating a food truck requires adherence to various municipal and health regulations to ensure public safety and hygiene. Central Mumbai, being a densely populated area, is strictly monitored by local authorities. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) mandates that all food businesses, including mobile food trucks, obtain a health license before commencing operations. This license is part of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) guidelines, which ensure that the food sold to the public meets certain safety and quality standards. Operating a food truck without such a license can lead to significant legal consequences, including fines and the potential shutdown of the business.

**Trivia:** Food trucks in Mumbai offer a diverse range of cuisines reflecting the city's rich cultural mix. From local Maharashtrian snacks to international dishes, food trucks have become a popular eating spot for both locals and tourists, contributing significantly to the city's vibrant street food culture.
