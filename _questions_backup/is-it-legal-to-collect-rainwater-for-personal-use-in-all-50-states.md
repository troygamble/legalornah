The legality of collecting rainwater for personal use varies by state in the United States. While many states encourage rainwater harvesting and have laws that support its practice, a few have restrictions or require permits. States like Colorado and Utah had strict regulations historically, but have since relaxed those rules, though some specific limitations still apply. For example, Colorado allows rainwater collection from rooftops if it is used for outdoor purposes such as gardening and only under certain conditions.

**Trivia:** Did you know that rainwater harvesting has been practiced for thousands of years? Ancient civilizations in India and Rome used cisterns and other systems to collect and store rainwater for irrigation, drinking, and other purposes.
