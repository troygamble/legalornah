In downtown Toronto, as in most cities in Canada, operating a food truck without undergoing a health inspection is illegal. All food trucks must adhere to the municipal health and safety regulations, which are enforced to ensure that the food served to the public is safe and the environment in which it is prepared and served is sanitary. This involves obtaining a valid food handling permit, which can only be issued after a successful health inspection by city health officials. The inspection checks for compliance with food safety practices, proper waste disposal, and overall cleanliness of the food truck.

**Trivia:** Toronto is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering a wide range of cuisines from around the world. This culinary diversity is celebrated annually at various food truck festivals throughout the city.
