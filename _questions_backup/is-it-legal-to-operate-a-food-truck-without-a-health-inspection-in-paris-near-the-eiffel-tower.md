In Paris, as in the rest of France, operating a food truck requires adherence to specific health and safety regulations, which include mandatory health inspections. These regulations are enforced to ensure that the food served to the public meets safety standards, thereby protecting public health. Food truck operators must obtain a permit from the local authorities, which is only granted after a successful health inspection. This inspection assesses various factors including food handling, storage, and preparation practices.

**Trivia:** The food truck trend became popular in Paris around 2012, significantly later than in places like Los Angeles, where food trucks have been popular since the 1970s. Parisian food trucks offer a variety of cuisines, reflecting the city's international influence.
