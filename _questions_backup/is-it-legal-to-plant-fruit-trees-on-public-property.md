The legality of planting fruit trees on public property varies by location and is governed by local laws, regulations, and policies. Generally, individuals are not allowed to alter or use public property, including planting trees, without permission from the relevant governmental authority. This is because public lands are managed to serve the interests of the community as a whole, and unauthorized alterations could interfere with those plans or cause unintended consequences.

**Trivia:** In some cities around the world, there are community initiatives and urban orchards where citizens can legally plant and maintain fruit trees on public property, often as part of a larger effort to improve local food security and community aesthetics.
