In Toronto, Canada, as in the rest of Ontario, it is illegal to operate an unregistered vehicle on public roads. According to the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario, all motor vehicles must be registered with the Ministry of Transportation. This registration process includes obtaining a valid license plate and a vehicle permit, which must be renewed periodically. The law is designed to ensure that all vehicles on the road are accounted for and meet certain safety and environmental standards. Driving an unregistered vehicle can lead to significant fines, the impoundment of the vehicle, and possibly other legal consequences.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the first vehicle registration plates in Canada were introduced in 1903? Ontario was the first province to require these plates, making it a pioneer in vehicle registration and regulation in Canada.
