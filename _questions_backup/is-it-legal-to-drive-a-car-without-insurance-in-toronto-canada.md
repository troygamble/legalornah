In Toronto, as in the rest of Ontario, it is illegal to drive a car without having valid car insurance. The law requires all motor vehicles to be insured under a policy that covers third-party liability of at least $200,000. This insurance helps cover damages or injuries to another person or their property in the event of an accident. Driving without insurance can lead to severe penalties including fines ranging from $5,000 to $50,000, the possible suspension of your driverâ€™s license, and the impoundment of your vehicle.

**Trivia:** Did you know that Ontario was one of the first provinces in Canada to require mandatory car insurance? This law has been in effect since 1980.
