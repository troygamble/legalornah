In New York City, it is illegal to sell food without a health license. The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene requires all businesses that engage in the selling or serving of food to obtain a permit or license. This regulation ensures that all food served to the public meets safety standards, which helps prevent foodborne illnesses. The process of obtaining a license involves inspections and adherence to specific health codes, including proper food handling, storage, and preparation practices. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in fines, closure of the establishment, or other legal actions.

**Trivia:** Did you know that New York City was one of the first cities in the United States to implement a letter grading system for food establishments? Since its introduction in 2010, the grading system has provided a clear and accessible way for consumers to assess the cleanliness and safety of restaurants.
