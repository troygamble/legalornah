In Mumbai, as in many other cities, operating a food truck requires obtaining specific permits and licenses from local municipal authorities. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) oversees the issuance of these permits, which are necessary to ensure that all food vendors comply with health, safety, and zoning regulations. Without these permits, a food truck operation would be considered illegal and could be subject to fines, penalties, or even closure by local law enforcement or health inspectors.

**Trivia:** Mumbai's street food culture is renowned worldwide, and the city is especially famous for its 'Vada Pav' and 'Pav Bhaji'. Food trucks add a modern twist to this vibrant street food scene, offering a variety of cuisines and innovative dishes that cater to the cosmopolitan population of the city.
