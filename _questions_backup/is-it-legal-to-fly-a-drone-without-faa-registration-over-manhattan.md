Flying a drone over Manhattan without FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) registration is generally illegal. According to FAA regulations, all drones weighing more than 0.55 pounds (250 grams) and less than 55 pounds (approx. 25 kilograms) must be registered if they are to be flown outdoors. This registration process involves providing the FAA with personal details and the drone's specifications. Moreover, Manhattan, being densely populated and having numerous heliports along with restricted airspace, has additional restrictions. Drone operators must also comply with specific safety guidelines and are usually required to keep the drone within visual line of sight at all times.

**Trivia:** Did you know? The first FAA-approved drone delivery in the United States happened in 2016, when a drone delivered medical supplies in rural Virginia.
