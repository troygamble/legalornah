In Sydney's CBD, the legality of renting out an apartment on Airbnb depends on several factors including local zoning laws, the specific by-laws of the building, and state regulations. New South Wales (NSW) state law allows short-term rental accommodation (STRA) but with certain conditions. Hosts must register their property with the NSW Government and comply with a code of conduct that includes safety and insurance requirements. Furthermore, if the apartment is part of a strata scheme, the owners' corporation has the authority to adopt by-laws that can restrict or prohibit short-term rentals. These by-laws might require that the apartment be the host's principal place of residence or limit the number of days it can be rented out annually.

**Trivia:** Sydney's iconic Opera House was once projected to cost $7 million and take four years to build. Instead, it took 14 years and over $100 million, becoming a globally recognized architectural marvel and a prime spot visible from many Airbnb rentals in the area.
