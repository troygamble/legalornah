In France, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without having insurance. This requirement is governed by French law, specifically under the Code des assurances (Insurance Code). Every motor vehicle operating on public roads in France must be covered by at least third-party liability insurance, known in French as 'assurance responsabilit√© civile'. This type of insurance covers any damage or injury that the driver might cause to other people or property in the event of an accident. Failure to have at least this minimum coverage can result in severe penalties including fines, impoundment of the vehicle, and in some cases, suspension of the driver's license.

**Trivia:** France was one of the first countries to introduce the concept of compulsory vehicle insurance. This was established to ensure that all victims of road accidents receive compensation, which reflects the principle of solidarity that is prevalent in many aspects of French public policy.
