In New York City, using a drone for commercial purposes without a license is illegal. Federal regulations, specifically those set forth by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), require that anyone operating a drone for commercial purposes must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate under Part 107 of the FAA regulations. This certification process involves passing an aeronautical knowledge test at an FAA-approved testing center. Additionally, New York City has stringent local laws concerning the use of drones due to safety and privacy concerns. These laws restrict drone usage in most parts of the city, and commercial operators must ensure they comply with both federal and local regulations to legally operate drones.

**Trivia:** New York City is known for its strict regulations on drones, yet it hosted its first ever Drone Film Festival in 2015, celebrating the art of drone cinematography.
