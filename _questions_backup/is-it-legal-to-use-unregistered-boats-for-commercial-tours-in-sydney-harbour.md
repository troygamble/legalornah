In Sydney Harbour, all commercial vessels, including boats used for tours, are required to be registered with the appropriate maritime authorities. This registration helps ensure that the vessels meet specific safety and operational standards, which are crucial for protecting passengers, crew, and the marine environment. The registration process involves inspections and compliance with regulations set by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) and the New South Wales Maritime Authority. These bodies enforce standards related to the construction, maintenance, and operation of commercial vessels, including life-saving and fire-fighting equipment, navigation and communication devices, and pollution control measures.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is home to the iconic Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge, and it is one of the busiest maritime areas in the world. It hosts over 15 million passengers annually on ferries and charter vessels.
