In downtown Toronto, Canada, it is illegal to operate a food truck without obtaining a health permit. The City of Toronto mandates that all food trucks must comply with the Toronto Municipal Code, which requires a valid health permit to ensure that the food served to the public meets safety standards. This permit is issued by Toronto Public Health after a thorough inspection of the food truck to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations. The inspection covers various aspects such as food handling, storage, employee hygiene, and sanitation practices.

**Trivia:** Food trucks in Toronto not only serve a wide variety of cuisines but also participate in annual food truck festivals that attract both locals and tourists, making them an integral part of the city's vibrant culinary scene.
