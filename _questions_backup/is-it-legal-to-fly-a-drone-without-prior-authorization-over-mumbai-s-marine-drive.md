Flying a drone without prior authorization over Mumbai's Marine Drive is generally prohibited under Indian aviation regulations. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in India has established specific guidelines for the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones. These regulations categorize drones based on their weight and specify the zones where drone operations are allowed or restricted. Marine Drive, being a densely populated area and a significant tourist attraction, falls under the 'No Drone Zones' unless specific permission is granted by the DGCA. Operators must obtain a Unique Identification Number (UIN) and an Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit (UAOP) for drones weighing more than 250 grams, and adhere to the prescribed safety and privacy guidelines.

**Trivia:** Drones are increasingly used in India for a variety of purposes, including agricultural monitoring, film-making, and disaster management. However, due to security concerns, especially in crowded urban areas like Mumbai, strict regulations have been implemented to prevent unauthorized use that could lead to accidents or privacy violations.
