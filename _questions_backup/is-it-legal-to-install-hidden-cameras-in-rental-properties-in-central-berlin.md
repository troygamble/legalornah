In Germany, the installation of hidden cameras in rental properties, including those in central Berlin, is generally illegal. This prohibition is grounded in the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz) and the right to privacy enshrined in the German Constitution. The law specifically protects the personal privacy and data of individuals, and the unauthorized use of surveillance equipment such as hidden cameras in areas where individuals expect privacy, such as in rental properties, is considered a violation of these rights. Landlords are not permitted to install hidden cameras in private areas of rented accommodations, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, or even living rooms, without the explicit consent of the tenant.

**Trivia:** In Germany, the right to privacy is so highly valued that the country has specific 'personality rights' in its legal system, which protect the individual's right to control how their image and personal information are used.
