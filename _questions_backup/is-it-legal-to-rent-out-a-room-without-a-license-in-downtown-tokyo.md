In Tokyo, the legality of renting out a room without a specific license primarily depends on the duration of the rental and the type of accommodation being offered. For short-term rentals, such as those commonly listed on platforms like Airbnb, the Japanese government has implemented a nationwide law known as the Minpaku Law, which came into effect in June 2018. This law requires hosts to register with local authorities and obtain a license if they wish to rent out their homes for less than 30 consecutive days. However, for long-term rentals, which are typically considered to be those lasting over 30 days, a specific Minpaku license is not required, but landlords must comply with other relevant real estate and rental laws, such as ensuring proper registration and meeting building codes.

**Trivia:** The Minpaku Law was introduced in Japan to address the growing number of tourists and to regulate the burgeoning market of short-term home rentals, which had been operating in a legal gray area. This law not only helps in managing residential concerns but also ensures safety and compliance standards are met to support tourism infrastructure.
