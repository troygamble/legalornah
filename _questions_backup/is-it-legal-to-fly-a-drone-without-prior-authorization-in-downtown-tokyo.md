In Japan, flying drones in densely populated areas, such as downtown Tokyo, is generally prohibited without specific authorization from the relevant authorities. The Japanese Civil Aviation Bureau regulates the use of drones through the Unmanned Aircraft / Drone Regulation, which stipulates that drones cannot be flown in areas where they may cause disturbances or pose risks to the public. This includes areas around airports, above certain altitudes, and in crowded city centers. To legally operate a drone in such restricted zones, operators must obtain permission from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), which involves demonstrating that the flight will not pose safety risks and complies with local regulations.

**Trivia:** In an effort to promote tourism and create a safe environment for drone usage, Japan has designated specific zones known as 'Drone Parks' where enthusiasts can freely fly their drones. These parks are typically located away from crowded urban centers and sensitive installations.
