In Paris, France, the legality of renting out a property on Airbnb without a license depends on several factors, including the duration of the rental and the type of property being rented. For short-term rentals, specifically those less than 120 days per year, property owners are required to register the property with the city authorities. This registration process provides a registration number that must be displayed on any rental listings. Additionally, if the property is not the owner's primary residence, a commercial use authorization may be required to legally rent it out on platforms like Airbnb. Failing to comply with these regulations can result in hefty fines.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the most active markets for Airbnb, with thousands of listings across the city. The city's efforts to regulate short-term rentals are partly due to concerns over housing shortages and the preservation of residential spaces in its historic areas.
