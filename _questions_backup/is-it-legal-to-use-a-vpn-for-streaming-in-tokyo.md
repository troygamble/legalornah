title: "Is it legal to use a VPN for streaming in Tokyo?"
short_answer: "Depends"
disclaimer: "This is not legal advice. Laws may vary by region."

In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the use of VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) is generally legal. VPNs are commonly used for enhancing security and privacy online. However, the legality of using a VPN for streaming content hinges on the content being accessed and the terms of service of the streaming platform. Japanese law does not specifically outlaw the use of VPNs for accessing geo-restricted content, but streaming services often have clauses in their terms of service that prohibit the use of tools like VPNs to circumvent geo-restrictions. Therefore, while the use of the VPN itself is not illegal, violating the terms of service of a streaming platform can lead to account suspension or other penalties from the service provider.

**Trivia:** Japan is known for its strict anti-piracy laws, which were further tightened in 2020. The revised laws made downloading copyrighted material, knowingly, a punishable offense, which includes not just music and videos but also images, and even academic texts.
