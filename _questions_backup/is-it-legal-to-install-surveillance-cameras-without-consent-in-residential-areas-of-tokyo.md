In Tokyo, as in the rest of Japan, the legality of installing surveillance cameras in residential areas without consent hinges on various factors including location, purpose, and privacy considerations. The installation of surveillance cameras in public spaces or areas where individuals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy is generally permissible. However, installing cameras directly aimed at private spaces such as inside someone’s home or in private areas of a residential building without consent is likely to be illegal. This is in line with Japan’s protection of personal privacy rights under its constitution and the Act on the Protection of Personal Information.

**Trivia:** In Japan, the use of surveillance cameras has surged in recent years, particularly in Tokyo, due to concerns over security as the city prepared for events like the 2020 Olympics. Interestingly, this has sparked debates on privacy versus security, mirroring global discussions.
