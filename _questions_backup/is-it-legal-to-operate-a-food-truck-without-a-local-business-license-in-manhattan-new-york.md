In Manhattan, New York, it is illegal to operate a food truck without obtaining a local business license. The City of New York requires all food trucks to have a valid Mobile Food Vendor License issued by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. This license is crucial to ensure that all food sold to the public meets health and safety standards. Additionally, food truck operators must comply with specific local regulations that might include zoning laws, parking restrictions, and specific operational guidelines that vary from one borough to another, including Manhattan.

**Trivia:** New York City is known for its diverse food truck scene, offering a variety of cuisines from around the world. The city's first food truck dates back to the late 17th century when street vendors used pushcarts to sell food to locals.
