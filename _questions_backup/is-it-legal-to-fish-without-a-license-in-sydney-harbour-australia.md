In Sydney Harbour, as in the rest of New South Wales, it is generally illegal to fish without a valid fishing license. This requirement is enforced by the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) under the Fisheries Management Act 1994. The law mandates that anyone engaging in recreational fishing in New South Wales' waters, including Sydney Harbour, must have a current fishing license. This applies to both residents and visitors, and covers all forms of recreational fishing, using various fishing gear or methods. There are, however, certain exceptions such as fishing in private dams or when under the age of 18, among others.

**Trivia:** Sydney Harbour is home to an annual event known as the 'Sydney Harbour Regatta,' which includes a variety of water sports and activities, including fishing competitions. This event attracts both local and international participants and showcases the vibrant marine life and scenic views of the harbour.
