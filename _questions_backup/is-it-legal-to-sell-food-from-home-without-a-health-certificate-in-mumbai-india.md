In Mumbai, India, the legality of selling food from home without a health certificate generally depends on the scale of the operation and the type of food being sold. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) mandates that anyone involved in the food business, including small-scale or home-based vendors, must obtain a registration or license. This requirement is part of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which aims to ensure that food products are safe for consumption. For very small-scale operations, such as selling homemade snacks on an occasional basis, the regulations might be less stringent, but it's advisable to check with local health departments.

**Trivia:** The concept of Dabbawalas, who deliver home-cooked food to office workers in Mumbai, is a unique food distribution system recognized for its efficiency and reliability, operating within the framework of Indian food safety regulations.
