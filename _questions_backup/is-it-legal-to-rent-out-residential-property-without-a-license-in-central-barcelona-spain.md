In central Barcelona, Spain, the legality of renting out residential property without a license depends on several factors, including the type of rental and the duration. For short-term rentals, such as those often listed on platforms like Airbnb, a license is generally required. The local government in Barcelona has implemented strict regulations to manage the influx of tourists and protect the local housing market. Property owners must obtain a tourist license to legally rent their homes for short periods. Failure to comply can result in hefty fines. For long-term rentals, a tourist license is not required, but landlords must comply with other legal requirements under Spanish rental law, such as registering the lease with the local authorities.

**Trivia:** Barcelona's strict regulations on short-term rentals were partly a response to the city's rising concerns about over-tourism, which has been credited with driving up local housing prices and altering neighborhood dynamics.
