In Florida, it is generally illegal to carry a concealed weapon without a permit. Florida law requires individuals who wish to carry a concealed firearm to obtain a Concealed Weapon License (CWL) issued by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. This license requires the applicant to fulfill certain criteria, including completing a firearms training course, undergoing a background check, and being a resident of the state. Carrying a concealed weapon without meeting these requirements can lead to significant legal penalties, including fines and imprisonment.

**Trivia:** Florida was one of the first states to enact a 'shall-issue' concealed carry law in 1987, significantly influencing concealed carry legislation across the United States.
