In Toronto, as in the rest of Ontario, it is illegal to drive a vehicle without car insurance. The law requires all motor vehicles to be insured under a liability insurance policy that covers at least the minimum amount prescribed by the regulations. This insurance helps cover costs in case you cause damage to another person or their property while driving. Driving without insurance can result in severe penalties including fines, vehicle impoundment, and suspension of your driver's license. The minimum penalty for driving without insurance in Ontario is a fine that can range from $5,000 to $25,000 on a first offense.

**Trivia:** Interestingly, Ontario has one of the highest average car insurance rates in Canada, which can be attributed to the high population density, the greater number of vehicles, and the higher frequency of insurance claims in the province.
