In Cape Town, as well as in other parts of South Africa, the legality of fishing without a license depends on the type of fishing and the area where it is conducted. For recreational fishing in coastal areas, a license is generally required. The South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) regulates marine recreational activities, and obtaining a permit is necessary to fish in the ocean. These permits are typically available at post offices and some local stores. However, there are exceptions during certain times of the year or for specific types of small-scale fishing, where a license might not be needed.

**Trivia:** Did you know that the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town offers a unique experience where visitors can dive in the tanks? This gives divers a close-up view of marine life, including species commonly found in the waters around Cape Town.
