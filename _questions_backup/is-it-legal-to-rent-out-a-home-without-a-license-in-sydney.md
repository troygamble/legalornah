In Sydney, whether you need a license to rent out a home depends on the type of rental arrangement and the specific local regulations. Generally, for long-term residential leases, there is no need for a specific rental license. However, if you're planning to engage in short-term holiday letting, such as through platforms like Airbnb or VRBO, the rules are different. New South Wales, which includes Sydney, has specific regulations that require hosts to register their property with the NSW Government if they wish to rent it out for short-term holiday letting. This registration process ensures compliance with safety standards and local laws.

**Trivia:** Sydney's unique approach to regulating short-term rentals came into sharper focus in recent years due to the city's housing affordability crisis and the impact of tourism on local neighborhoods. These regulations aim to balance the economic benefits of tourism with the needs of local residents.
