In downtown Toronto, it is illegal to operate a food truck without obtaining the necessary licenses and permits. The City of Toronto mandates that all food truck operators must have a valid business license, which involves compliance with various health and safety regulations, zoning laws, and sometimes even specific local bylaws. The licensing process is designed to ensure that food sold to the public meets health standards and that the operation does not obstruct public spaces or cause safety issues.

**Trivia:** Toronto's food truck scene has significantly evolved over the years. Initially, restrictive bylaws limited food trucks to specific locations and times. However, changes in regulations now allow greater flexibility, enabling food trucks to become a vibrant part of the city's culinary landscape, particularly during festivals and special events.
