In Amsterdam, the legality of smoking cannabis in public spaces is not straightforward and depends on specific circumstances and local regulations. Generally, smoking cannabis in public is discouraged and can be subject to fines or police intervention, especially near schools, playgrounds, or in busy areas like shopping streets or public transport stations. The city authorities aim to maintain public order and prevent nuisance, thus enforcement can vary based on the location and situation.

**Trivia:** Amsterdam is famous for its 'coffeeshops,' establishments where the sale of cannabis for personal consumption is tolerated by the local authorities. These coffeeshops are a significant part of the city's tourism industry, attracting millions of visitors each year who are interested in the liberal drug policies.
