In central Paris, the legality of renting out your home on Airbnb without a permit depends on several factors, including the duration and frequency of the rental. According to Parisian regulations, if you are renting out your primary residence (where you live for at least 8 months a year), you can do so for up to 120 days per year without a special permit. However, if the property is not your primary residence, or if you wish to rent it out for more than 120 days per year, you are required to register the property with the city authorities. Additionally, you must obtain a commercial use authorization if you are converting residential space into a commercial rental property. Failure to comply with these rules can result in hefty fines.

**Trivia:** Paris is one of the top Airbnb markets in the world, with thousands of listings available across the city. The city has implemented strict regulations to preserve housing availability for residents, addressing concerns that short-term rentals might exacerbate housing shortages.
