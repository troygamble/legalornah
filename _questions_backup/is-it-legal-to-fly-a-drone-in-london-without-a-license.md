In London, as in the rest of the UK, whether you can fly a drone without a license depends primarily on the weight of the drone and its intended use. Drones weighing less than 250 grams may generally be flown without a license for recreational purposes. However, for drones weighing 250 grams or more, or if the drone is used for commercial purposes, you must register with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and pass an online education test to receive a flyer ID. Furthermore, regardless of the drone's weight, certain areas in London, especially those near airports and in controlled airspace, have specific restrictions where drone flying might require additional permissions or be outright prohibited.

**Trivia:** In London, the Royal Parks are popular spots for tourists and locals alike, but flying drones in these parks is generally prohibited without special permission. This regulation helps to ensure safety and preserve the peaceful enjoyment of these public spaces.
